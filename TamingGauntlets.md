# Taming Gauntlets
The concept of a Taming Gauntlet can help explain how formally wild monsters are now understanding the commands of a Tamer.  Furthermore, if desired it can be ruled that the Creatures Themselves can be summoned from the Taming Gauntlet.

This concept can be used in either a High-Magic or High-Tech Setting.  

Different Gauntlets are Described below, including their effects

## Gauntlet List

-**Name** - **Commerce Points** - Effect
- **Basic Gauntlet** - 2 - Permits Taming.
- **Healing Gauntlet** -2 - Creatures controlled with this Gauntlet can be more easily healed.  When performing a roll to Heal a creature controlled with Gauntlet add +3d6 to your dice pool. 
- **Elite Gauntlet** - 3 - +1 successes when taming
- **Masterwork Gauntlet** - 3 - +2 successes when taming 
- **Type Gauntlet** - 3 - Gain +2 success when Taming a creature of a given Type, and -2 when taming all other creatures.
- **Scale Gauntlet** - 4 - For the purposes of taming you Scale is considered one larger than normal.  Remember for taming you have the Scale of your Largest creature.  So if you have a +1 Scale (due to a creature you already control) for taming, with this Gauntlet you would have a scale of 2.
