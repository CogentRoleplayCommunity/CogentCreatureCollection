## Dice Pools
While Cogent is a Story Driven roleplaying game, there are times when a Player can not resolve a situation by roleplaying alone.  When this happens, Cogent uses the **Dice Pool** mechanic.  
1. ## Calculate your Dice Pool
    The number of dice you roll for a given **Dice Pool** is a combination of the following factors:
    * **Base Dice:** 3D6 unless stated otherwise.
    * **Attribute:** Every *Core Skill*, *Vocation*, and *Vocational Skill* has an associated *Attribute*.  Add this many D6 to your **Dice Pool**
    * **Vocation:** If you are making a *Core Skill* roll, this will be 0D6, otherwise add the number of D6 for the *Vocational Skill*'s *Vocation* to your **Dice Pool**
    * **Skill:** Add the number of D6 for either the *Core Skill* or *Vocational Skill* to your **Dice Pool**
    * **Modifiers:** There are several other factors that can add or remove D6 from your **Dice Pool**.  These include but are not limited to; Injuries, Equipment, Environmental Conditions, and/or other factors declared by the Narrator

1. ## Narrator Declares the CL
    Cogent has an associated *Cheetsheet* that is available for Narrators and Players alike.  Within the *Cheetsheet* is the % chance of success for any given **Dice Pool** vs an associated *Challenge Level* (CL).  To calculate the CL, the Narrator will determine the average **Dice Pool** of a Character attempting the same dice roll, and the % chance of success they would have.  Find the corresponding CL and notify the Player.

1. ## 3. Calculate Narrative Success or Failure
    If a Character has a **Dice Pool** that is greater than the CL, the Character is capable of completing the task at hand.  Making a dice roll determines how well they accomplish the task at hand.  This is determined by calculating *Wins* and *Losses*, and comparing them to the CL.
    * **Wins and Loses**
        When rolling a D6 if the results is a 4, 5, or 6, then it is considered a **Win**, otherwise it is considered a **Loss**.
    * **Advantage and Disadvantage**
        Before making a dice roll, the Narrator may declare that the **Dice Pool** has *Advantage*, or *Disadvantage*.<br/>
        If the **Dice Pool** has *Advantage*, then a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 is considered a **Win**.<br/>
        If the **Dice Pool** has *Disadvantage*, then a roll of 5, or 6 is considered a **Win**. 
    
    * **Narrative Success or Failure**
        Narrative Success is when the Character generates more Wins than the CL.  The Narrator should treat Narrative Successes as strokes of luck (the lock takes less time to pick, the sword found the gap in the armour, the bard is inspired by their muse, etc), with higher Narrative Success being greater strokes of luck.<br/>
        Narrative Failure is when the Character generates less Wins than the CL.  The Narrator should treat Narrative Success as complications (the lock pick breaks, the sword deflects off the armour, the bard has writer's block, etc) and these complications will hinder the Character, but may or may not prevent them from accomplishing the task.  

*Example*
> Erin the Mage wants to strategically cast a fireball into a group of goblins.  The Narrator determines that they will need to roll a Sorcery Vocational skill check.
> * Erin's Player calculates Erin's **Dice Pool** as 5D6.  3D6 (Base) + 1D6 (Intelligence) + 1D6 (Mage Vocation) + 1D6 (Sorcery)
> * The Narrator reminds Erin's Player about their *Wand of Power* and tells them to add +1D6 to their **Dice Pool** for a total of 6D6.  Further to this, the Narrator tells them that the goblins are completely unaware of Erin's presence and they have *Advantage* on their **Dice Pool**.
> * Using the *Cheetsheet* as a guide, the Narrator feels that the fireball (a powerful spell) would be a significant strain on an average Mage.  The Narrator uses a **Dice Pool** of 4D6 and a difficulty of 31% pass rate to generate a CL 3.
> * Erin's Player rolls their dice and gets 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, and 5.  This generates 5 successes or a Narrative Success of +2.
> 
> The fireball lands on the group of goblins and sets them all on fire.  The spell casting was so effective that the heat generated causes Medium Injuries (-2D6 Injury Penalty) to each of the goblins that are on fire.

## Destiny Rolls
In many tabletop roleplaying games there is a need to make multiple dice rolls, one after another for effects that occur "off screen".  To prevent the Narrator and Players from having to roll more dice than absolute necessary, Cogent uses the **Destiny Roll**.<br/>
All **Destiny Rolls** are done with 1D20.  The CL for the **Destiny Roll** is based on the difficulty of combined tasks.
| **Difficulty (%)** | 5% | 10% | 15% | 20% | 25% | 30% | 35% | 40% | 45% | 50% | 55% | 60% | 65% | 70% | 75% | 80% | 85% | 90% | 95% | 100% |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **CL** | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

The dice roll for the **Destiny Roll** must be equal or greater than the CL for the roll.

*Example*
> King John's men are traveling through Sherwood Forest with the latest taxes.  They know that Robin Hood and his Merry Men are planning to ambush the convoy, but King John's men have devised several new paths through the forest.<br/>
> The Narrator states that there is roughly a 75% chance that King John's men will hit one of the Merry Men's ambush points, but instead of rolling multiple navigation and perception skill checks, the Narrator decides to do a **Destiny Roll** instead.<br/>
> Since the Players are part of the Merry Men, the Narrator sets the CL at 16 (100% - 75% = 25%) and rolls 13 or a Narrative Failure of -3.  The convoy rolls right into the ambush, but their agitated state means they were not fully caught unaware.  

## Assists and Collaborations
Many hands make quick work.  Within Cogent there are two methods that Characters can help each other out; the first is using *Assists*, and the second is using *Collaborations*.<br/>
**Assists** are when the results of on Character's dice roll, directly affects another Character's dice roll.  Whenever any Character declares they are making a dice roll, another Character can declare they are making an *Assist*.  They must declare how they are *Assisting*, and the Narrator will set the CL based on how likely the *Assist* will benefit the *Assisted* dice roll.  The Narrator may apply *Narrative Success or Failure* in the following ways:
* **Temporary Destiny Points:** The *Assisted* dice roll has their Destiny Pool increased or decreased for this dice roll only.
* **Modify the CL:** The *Assisted* dice roll has the CL increased or decreased as per the Narrator's discretion (*note: Narrators should convert the Narrative Success or Failure rather than use a straight 1 to 1 change to the CL*).
* **Add Modifier Dice:** The Narrative Success or Failure becomes *Modified* dice for the *Assisted* dice roll.

*Example*
> Rick the Ranger is setting up the campsite for the adventures.  To *Assist* in this, Paula the Paladin has decided to gather firewood, and Steve the Sorcerer has decided to use Sorcery to help start the fire.  The Narrator has Paula make a Survival check against a CL 3 to find firewood, and she generates a Narrative Failure of -1 Narrative Failure (coming back short).  The Narrator says this is a setback, but doesn't directly hinder Rick's attempts to set up camp (-1 Destiny Pool).  Steve makes a Sorcery check against a CL 2 and generates +4 Narrative Successes.  The Narrator says this is saves Rick a bunch of time trying to get the fire going and as a result the CL is reduced by -2 CL.  Rick makes his Wildcraft skill check against a new CL 1 (3-2) and generates +3 Narrative Successes.<br/>
> The Adventurers have a filling meal and a great nights rest.

**Collaborations** are when multiple Characters are attempting the same dice roll at the same time.  All the Characters will calculate their own **Dice Pools**, but the CL will be calculated for the group, not the individuals.  The Narrator will calculate the CL based on an average number of Characters or average ability and determine the, per individual, CL for the task.  The Narrator will then multiply this CL by the average number of Characters needed to get the CL for the group.

*Example*
> The portcullis is down and the Adventurers are attempting to escape.  Paula the Paladin encourages everyone by saying "All together now!" and everyone attempts to lift the portcullis.<br/>
> The Narrator states that if 4 Characters of average Athletics were to attempt this lift, it would be possible, but hard.  Looking at the *Cheetsheet*, a **Dice Pool** of 4D6 and a % chance to succeed of 31%, would set a CL 3.  The Narrator tells the group that the Collaboration CL is CL 3x4 or CL 12.<br/>
> The Adventurers make their rolls and get 3, 2, 2, 3 Wins each for a total of 10 Wins or -2 Narrative Failure.  Since the combined **Dice Pools** of all the Adventurers is greater than the CL, the Narrator states that the portcullis isn't dropped properly when the go under, and each Adventurer gains a -2 Injury Level that can be reduced by armour.
