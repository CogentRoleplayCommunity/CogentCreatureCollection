## What is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game
A tabletop roleplaying game is a type of board game that blends elements of telling campfire stories with improve and war games.  Tabletop roleplaying games grew out of the War Game industry in the 1970's and has become mainstream thanks to Dungeons and Dragons and the work of groups like Critical Roll.<br/>
Between the different tabletop roleplaying games, there are games that emphasize more on the rules (such as Dungeons and Dragons) and games that emphasize more on storytelling (such as Cogent).  Each game will cater to a different type of Player.<br>
Tabletop roleplaying games come in many common settings including, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Historical, Horror, and Comedy/Parody.<br/>
* **Fantasy:** Any setting where magic, mysticism, or unexplainable supernatural elements are an expected part of the setting.  
* **Science Fiction:** Any setting where technology explains the supernatural elements of the setting.
* **Historic:** Any setting taken from a historic period, and incorporates the real, or idealized themes of that setting.
* **Horror:** Any setting where the Characters have a heightened sense of danger from an overwhelming source that they have no control over.  Players should expect their Characters will likely die in these types of settings.
* **Comedy/Parody:** Any setting meant to be light-hearted or a ludicrous twist on a more serious theme.
* **Mixed Setting:** A combination of 2 or more settings above (*example* Star Wars would be considered Science Fantasy and combine Fantasy (ie the Force) and Science Fiction (Space Travel))

## Terminology and Concepts
All Tabletop Roleplaying games have common terms that are used.  In addition to these common terms, Cogent has some additional terms that new players may want to know.  
| **Term** | **Definition** |
| ----- | ----- |
| #D6 | This is the number of six-sided dice you are expected to roll.  *Example:* 3D6 means you need to roll 3 six-sided dice |
| Attribute | Your *Attributes* represent your Character's physical abilities.  *Attributes* will likely never change over a *Story*, and rarely change over a *Campaign*.  In the world of biology, *Attributes* are the nature side of nature vs nurture. |
| Campaign | A *Campaign* is a collection of *Stories* that tie a common period in the lives of the Characters.  Campaigns should act in a similar way to a TV Season, or a Movie, with most of the main plot points resolved. |
| Character (PC, NPC) | A Character is any, in-story person that can, through their actions, affect the Story itself.  There are two sub-types of Characters; Player Characters (PC) who are Characters controlled by Players, and Non-Player Characters (NPC) who are Characters controlled by the Narrator. |
| CL | Challenge Level.  This is represents the level of difficulty to competently execute a task. |
| CP | Commerce Points.  This is an abstract method to track a Character's wealth. |
| Destiny Roll | One, twenty-sided dice that is rolled whenever a Destiny Roll is required.  Destiny Rolls are used instead of multiple consecutive dice rolls. |
| Narrator | (aka Game Master, Dungeon Master, or Storyteller) The role a narrator plays in a book, movie, or tv show is filled by this Player.  *See **Narrator** Chapter for a list of roles within the Story.* |
| Players | ie You.  All the people playing this game, excluding the Narrator.  Players typically only control on Character, referred to as the PC. |
| Session | (aka Game Session) A *Session* is a single Player meet-up to play Cogent.  *Sessions* take between 1-5 hours. |
| Skills | Your *Skills* represent all the experience your Character has gathered over their life.  *Skills* are broken into two groups; *Core Skills* and *Vocational Skills*.  *Core Skills* represent the universal abilities of all Characters, while *Vocational Skills* represent the trade specific knowledge a Character will gain.  In the world of biology, *Skills* are the nurture side of nature vs nurture. |
| Story | A *Story* is a collection of *Sessions*.  Stories should act in a similar way to a TV Episode, or Story Arc, with a set-up, climax, and resolution structure. |
| Vocations | *Vocations* are bodies of knowledge that closely align to jobs, professions, or careers.  All *Vocations* have a wide range of *Vocational Skills* associated with them, but Players will choose a sub-set of these *Vocational Skills* as their Character's *Vocational* specializations. |
