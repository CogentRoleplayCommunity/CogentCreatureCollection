## Opportunity Dice
Creatures and monsters are often found in **Hostile Environments**  PLayers will often have a limited amount of time before something bad happens (the **Consequence**) - space suits fail, a volcano explodes, a ship self destructs etc.  

(There should be a way for the story to continue if the "Something Bad" happens.

Opportunity Dice determine how much time the party has.  At the start of the situation a number of d6s are chosen.  Lets say 12d6 is chosen by the GM

At the end of each round the **Opportunity Die Pool** is rolled.  All 1-3s are removed from the pool.  Every 6 causes a d6 to be added to the pool.  

As such, each round the Opportunity Die Pool will get smaller and smaller (unless a lot of 6s are rolled).  If the *Opportunity Die Pool* hits zero, the "Something Bad" happens.   

## Increasing the Die Pool

If the players can use a skill to hold off the "Something Bad" the Narrator can set a *Challenge Level*.  Each level of victory above the challenge level adds a d6 to the *Opportunity Dice Pool*.
