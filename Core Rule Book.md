### Welcome to Cogent Roleplay

**Cogent Roleplay** – a Tabletop Pen and Paper Role-playing game that’s easy to learn, but has the depth and sophistication for the most demanding of role-players. The Cogent Roleplay System aims to provide you with the tools you need to experience adventures as any character you can imagine, such as a great hero, scoundrel, villain, thief, rogue or any other. Your stories will unfold in all kinds of worlds and settings, such as classic medieval fantasy, science fiction, space opera, zombie apocalypse, steampunk, superhero – or something of your own unique creation. Have fun, be fearless, and create your own stories worthy of the greatest myths and legends!


#### A Message from the Authors

Let us introduce ourselves – we are Josiah Brooks ([Jazza](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu2KNu6TtJ0p4hpSW7Yv7Q)) and Shad Brooks (of [Shadiversity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmMACUKpQeIxN9D9ARli1Q)), two nerdy brothers who have always enjoyed role-playing and all it has to offer. We created Cogent Roleplay to address the rampant problems in many PnP (Pen & Paper) RPGs (Role-playing Games), such as:



* Poor game structures that are kept purely for traditions' sake, preventing innovation.
* Huge, overly complex rules, that make it extremely difficult for new players, and bog down gameplay with redundant processes.
* Things that prevent player creativity. In Cogent, we want to empower players to attempt anything their characters could reasonably try, and not respond with, no, that’s not allowed in the rules.
* Role-playing games that put their mechanics before the true purpose of a pen-and-paper RPG, the narrative you create with your friends.

For these reasons we feel you’ll have a more rewarding experience with Cogent as it resolves all these issues while providing new and innovative ways to experience tabletop role-playing.

Cogent Roleplay is currently in its late Alpha phase, Beta soon, where the rules are being updated and improved regularly, as will the tools we create to accompany them – but even so, we believe Cogent has the potential to be the Tabletop RPG for the next generation – for these reasons:



* Cogent Roleplay is simple for beginners and easy to learn – but has a depth that can be mastered and explored by experienced players.
* In the new age of content, where video content, audiobooks and podcasts reign supreme – Cogent is uniquely structured to enable the best storytellers to tell interesting and diverse stories, naturally suited to every setting, genre and play style, and share them with the world.
* We understand that to build an RPG system that will cater to the widest range of stories and personalities, we need to be extremely community-oriented as we develop the rules and tools for Cogent – and we will build Cogent from the ground up to serve the community that builds and contributes to it.

We hope that Cogent provides you with endless hours of fun. If you have any suggestions regarding the rules or how the Cogent Roleplay system could be improved, please send us your feedback through our discord group and social media pages. With your help, we’ll polish and refine these rules to make Cogent the best pen-and-paper RPG system in the world.

Thanks for checking out Cogent Roleplay, we hope you have a blast!


### Introduction to Roleplaying


#### What is Roleplaying?

As the term implies, roleplaying means to take on the role of someone else, specifically, a character you will play the role of in your game. **Roleplaying** is by far the most important aspect of the **Cogent Roleplay **system. Everything in this game is made to promote better, more immersive and satisfying Role-play. That being said, the ultimate thing that’ll enable you to experience this is your own imagination and creativity.

Any character you take the role of could be yourself in a fictional setting; an alter-ego who just so happens to be a heroic knight, daring space captain or cunning super spy. On the other hand, the character you play could be someone completely different, which will often open up role-play experiences previously unimagined! In any case, being consistent and true to whatever character you’re playing will prove most rewarding.

The actions you attempt while role-playing is governed by simple rules and character statistics, where the roll of the dice determines the results. This dice rolling simulates the chaotic unpredictability and suspense of real life, there’s always a chance of failure – but failure isn’t a bad thing! Often it’s the failures that unlock the most suspense in your game, and result in some of the most hilarious stories.

The core structure of any Tabletop Role-Playing game is made of two components:



* Players who take on the role of the **player characters** (sometimes referred to as **PC**s), and act out the character’s dreams, goals and aspirations.
* A **Narrator** (traditionally referred to as a Game Master or Dungeon Master), who acts as a referee and drives the game and story forward by controlling the world that the players are interacting with.


#### How is Roleplaying Done?

Players take on the role of their character, meaning that regardless of their own ambitions or desires as a player, they should act how that character would act. Ideally, players at the table are trying to create a fun immersive experience, and how you approach character interaction will drastically affect that.

_Example of Non-Immersive Roleplaying:_


```
Marcus (played by John)
"My character says to Tim's character that we should be careful of an ambush."
```


The problem with interactions like this is that it’s impersonal. The players should attempt to step inside their own character and speak as that character. Therefore, if John’s character Marcus is a selfish and impatient rogue, the role-play might proceed something like this:


```
Marcus (played by John)
I say to Garath, "Hey meatbag, tread carefully! Bandits roam these parts and I wouldn't be surprised if some may be lying in wait to ambush us…"
```


John would then wait for Tim to respond in character. For example, if Tim’s character is a hot-tempered thick-headed warrior named Gareth, the role-play might proceed something like this:


```
Gareth (played by Tim)
"Foolish bandits, why would they be lying in wait if their intent is to ambush travelers? Surely it would take too much time to stand up!"
```


Speaking freely as your character (warts and all) will enhance the immersion of the game and make it a lot more fun. Not only should the player try to speak as their character, but they should speak the same way their character would speak. You can even speak in an accent if you want!

The player characters will come across many other characters controlled by the Narrator. These are called “non-player characters” and are often referred to as “NPCs.”

The Narrator is the most important person in any tabletop Role-playing game as you can’t play without one. They describe everything in the game’s world and setting to aid the players in visualizing the adventures. They run the game through the rules of the system, informing the players when they are required to make dice rolls, which will then determine the success or failure of their actions.

Ultimately, a well-crafted Pen and Paper Role-playing game provides structure and immersion to something humans have done for literally thousands of years; communal storytelling.


### A Quick Overview of Cogent

In the following chapters you will find all the rules for creating your own characters in Cogent Roleplay and everything you need to get started playing a game. The rulebook will first introduce you to Character Creation, Skills and Attributes, and then go through the game rules in detail.

While most people who have a passing knowledge of video games or tabletop roleplaying will have an innate understanding of many of the concepts presented here, we do not assume everyone has such knowledge from the get-go.

When playing a tabletop RPG, you create a character and tailor their abilities and skills by spending a pool of points you start the game with. This allows you to create anyone you would like, from a super-smart detective to a brawling boxer.

The in-depth game rules will be explained in Chapter 2, but before you read about creating your character it is worth mentioning the two core mechanics used in Cogent Roleplay.


#### Dice Pools and Challenge Levels

In games of Cogent, player characters must overcome challenges during gameplay. When asked to, they will create **Dice Pools** by combining the total number of points between their skill and attribute, adding three, and collecting that number of dice into a **Dice Pool**. The dice used in Cogent are six-sided dice, commonly known as **D6**’s.

While explained in far more depth later, in general, you roll these dice, looking to roll the numbers **4**, **5** and **6**. Which count as “**Wins**”.

The Narrator – That is, the person facilitating your game will set a **Challenge Level** (denoted **CL**) , which will be a number between **1** and **8,** that you need to equal or beat with your dice roll.

And that’s it – it simply boils down to collecting a number of **D6**’s based on your character's statistics, rolling them, and looking to score enough **wins** to beat the **Challenge Level**! If you manage to do that, you pass the check, and your character succeeds in the task they set out to do.


## Character Creation


### Character Identity

Tabletop Role-playing begins for the players with Character creation. Here you must think of a character you wish to play. This could be an alternate version of yourself or someone completely different. The possibilities are endless and you’ll always be able to find a character you want to play.

A real and well-rounded character can’t just be summarized into a morality archetype. A real person generally does both good things and bad things, motivated by core characteristics. This doesn’t mean that your character can’t be wholly good or wholly evil, just that a character’s actions shouldn’t be structured by the player character or Narrator around a pre-set archetype, as this will most likely produce a boring character. A wholly good character is still capable of bad things if they have a powerful enough reason or motivation to do so.

The key is being consistent with who your character is and you determine who they are at the very beginning.

Remember that in settings with action, swords, magic, guns or lasers, Characters die. Cogent Roleplay is a game with rules – rules that are there to provide an appropriate level of challenge. Sometimes failure will simply lead to your character’s death. This can (believe it or not) be fun. Your character may even opt to go out in a blaze of glory. Of course, sometimes it’s not particularly fun, but if the dice decide it’s your character's time to die then there’s not much that can be done about it! We suggest you always have a second character concept ready to make a new character in case your current character dies.


```
A few words on: Playing as a Group
Something that's quite important to keep in mind before you dive into making your character is the "party", the other characters your fellow players will be controlling.
The Party needs to have a reason to at least stick together. They don't necessarily have to get along; though it helps the party achieve their goals, getting along in-game isn't necessarily more or less fun. A character that doesn't mesh well with the other characters can actually add a lot of fun and realism in role-play, though it needs to be handled with maturity so players don't take offence to things the character does in game when the player is simply being true to their character. It's only difficult to play a character that doesn't get along with other characters when they don't get along so much that it's unrealistic for the characters to stay together.
As mentioned before the party needs at least a reason to stay together otherwise it defeats the purpose of the game. You can't play as a group if one of the characters leaves the party for in-game reasons. Still if a player does this out of being true to their character, there is nothing stopping them from making a new character that can join the party soon after.

```



#### Creating a Character

When making a character, try to match the seriousness and realism of them to the setting and genre you’re playing in. Make them real, give them goals and history. Indeed on the Cogent Roleplay Character Sheet, there are several Core Characteristic requirements to be filled out:


##### Character Disposition

Are they happy, sad, moody, funny, cautious, untrusting, stupid, smart, tactical, shy, or boisterous? The list can go on and on. This doesn’t mean that they can’t be in any other mood, just that generally a person’s standard disposition is quite consistent throughout their lives. It is often wise to base these dispositions on a character’s history and beliefs/morality, to build a character with depth and motive.


##### Character History

A good history can help shape who your character is in great ways. You don’t have to write a novel but generally the more detailed the better – of course, there isn’t a lot of room on the character sheet for detailed character history, but you may choose to write one elsewhere. A good history can make your character feel much more real which will then, in turn, help your role-play be more convincing, rewarding and fun.


##### Beliefs / Morality

It’s hard to find a person without a specific worldview, with defined things that they see as good or evil. So a realistic character should also have these things. Even having no morals or beliefs is a morality and a belief. No matter what you chose for your character you should always answer why your characters believe the things they do and **why** they see things as evil and things as good. This will define your character, even more.


##### Goals / Aspirations

Everybody has goals or aspirations. They’re one-way people give purpose to their lives, so what purpose does your character see for themselves? This specific characteristic will very much guide what your character will do in-game. It’s recommended that you choose several long-term and short-term goals and aspirations.

Following these suggestions will guide you to make a very well-defined character. The next step is to define them through their statistics.


### Attributes

Characters statistics in Cogent Roleplay can be broken down into two categories which determine the bonuses (or penalties) you receive when rolling against **Challenge Levels **(**CL**) encountered in the game, whether **Actions** and **Conflicts**. These categories are:


#### Attributes & Skills

By default, in **Fast Play** games (_see **How to Play**_) player characters will be given **2 Attributes Points** and **12 Skill Points** they may assign to their character during character creation.


#### Attributes

By default, in **Fast Play **games, player characters will be given **2 Attribute Points** they may assign to their character during character creation.  Generally, in **Campaign Play** (_see **How to Play**_) players will start with fewer points and gain more during the course of their adventure.

Attributes represent the physical abilities of your character.  There are three:



* **Strength (STR)**
* **Reflex (RFL)**
* **Intelligence (INT)**

On the Character Sheet they look like this:



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


When assigning a point to an attribute or skill, simply mark a box with your pencil as shown above.

The tapered “negative” box present represents the capacity for a character to have negatives in attributes. Players may not choose to have a negative in an attribute – it is only there in case a disabling characteristic or injury demands a negative be applied to an attribute.

These three attributes cover all of the actions your player might attempt. Upon first glance it can seem like many physical abilities or qualities a person can possess are missed (most other role-play systems have a lot more), such as stamina, constitution, speed, knowledge, charisma etc. but in Cogent, these things are incorporated into the three Attributes above. Things like constitution and stamina are covered in strength, speed in reflex, and knowledge and charisma in intelligence. There’s no need to over-complicate it!

Each of these attributes applies to certain skill checks and to all combat rolls. From a combat perspective, one point in Intelligence and one point in Reflex have the same dice bonus as two points in strength. This is because a fast or clever opponent may very well be just as challenging as a strong one.

In addition to granting bonus dice to appropriate rolls, each attribute also gives a specific advantage unrelated to dice checks. These are:



* **Strength**: For each point in **STR,** you may reduce an **Injury Level** by -1 once per Combat Encounter
* **Reflex**: Your **Initiative **is equal to the number of points in **RFL**.
* **Intelligence**: For each point in **INT**, you receive **+3 Skill Points** during character creation

An average person in any setting will have the equivalent of **0 points** in each. **1 point** in any of these attributes equates to the character being professional or naturally gifted in that area. **2 points** in any one attribute would equate to being elite or ‘world-class’ in that aspect.

_Example:_


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td><strong>0 Points</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>1 Point</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>2 Points</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Strength</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Average
   </td>
   <td>Soldier, Athlete
   </td>
   <td>Olympic Athlete
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Reflex</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Average
   </td>
   <td>Acrobat, Thief
   </td>
   <td>Bruce Lee
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Intelligence</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Average
   </td>
   <td>Professor, Politician
   </td>
   <td>Sherlock Holmes
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Some settings (depending on the narrator) may allow for over 2 points in one attribute. These are mostly justifiable through means of superhuman powers, genetic anomaly, magical enchantment or advanced technology.


### Core Skills

Where attributes showcase the raw physical and mental capabilities of a character, skills represent their learned or unlearned abilities.

In **Fast Play** games, player characters will be given **12 skill points** they may assign to their character during character creation. Players may gain additional points to spend in this phase by either accepting a Disabling Characteristic (See: “Disabling Characteristics”) or by assigning attribute points to Intelligence (+3 skill points per point in Intelligence.) In **Campaign Play**, players will also be able to gain skill points as the story progresses. Each point represents an additional die the character receives when making dice checks using the applicable skill.



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


Just like with Attributes, when assigning a point simply mark the box with your pencil as shown above. The tapered box on the far left is there to “cross out” if you take a negative in a skill. These skills can have a max of four points spent on each of them, and a player may also take a single ‘negative’ point from one of these skills, and apply the removed point elsewhere. (Note: This may only be done once, you cannot choose multiple negative skills at character creation)

Although this tapered “negative” box is also present in the Attributes section, players may not choose to have a negative in an attribute – it is only there in case a disabling characteristic demands a negative be applied to an attribute.

Every **skill** has an attribute (or attributes) it is based on. For example, the skill **“Persuasion”** is based on the Attribute **“Intelligence”.** When rolling a skill check you need to create the pool of dice that you will be rolling for the check. First, add the 3 dice that make up your base roll. Then, count the number of shaded boxes in the skill you are being asked to make a check for, as well as the number of shaded boxes in that skill’s core attribute. This forms your dice pool for any skill check and will be explained in depth in Chapter 2: **How to Play**.

For Example, your character has **1 point** in **Strength** and **3 points** in **Athletics**. When they perform an athletics check they will begin with their base of **3D6**, add **1D6** for their **STR** Attribute, and **3D6** for their Athletics skill. The result is **7D6** to roll with:


### 

<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


Skills checks may be attempted even if your character has no points spent on that specific skill. To do this, simply form your dice pool as normal, adding your base 3 dice to the number of shaded boxes in the relevant skill (+0 in the case of unskilled) and then adding a die for your skills core attribute.

Skills are divided into two categories:



* **Core Skills**: Strength/Reflex/Intelligence-based skills.
* **Vocational Skills**: Skills which define a character’s chosen path in life, be it a class, a career or a calling. These skills are crafted between the player and narrator and include combat proficiencies.


#### Core Skills in Detail

Core skills in Cogent Roleplay are meant to represent the scope of activities that everyday people are capable of attempting with some chance of success. It includes motions of the body and feats of strength, speed and thought that are near-universally used by all creatures. While sometimes more specific interpretations of these skills are relevant (For example, using ride/pilot to drive a car), the same skill could also be used for a beaver attempting to balance on a log as it floated downstream.

It is in this way that Core Skills primarily differ from Vocational Skills, as Vocational Skills cover tasks related to very specific or learned jobs.

Combat will be introduced fully in Chapter 4, but it is worth noting that Core Skills cannot be added to combat rolls. The only way Core Skills can aid combat rolls is through assists (see **Assists**, CH3, PT2.) Your combat skills will be covered in **Vocations,** CH3, PT4.


##### Strength-Based Skills

**Endurance**

Endurance is the physical trait that represents your body’s ability to process toxins and resist disease. Resisting food poisoning, hot and cold weather and pushing on past exhaustion are all domains of endurance. Endurance also makes wearing and fighting in heavy armour easier, which will be covered further in (**Armour**, Chapter 4, Part 3.)


```
Examples:
Approaching a raging inferno and pushing through the heat.
Travelling on a long journey with little to no sleep.
Holding your composure in a drinking competition.
```


**Athletics**

Athletics covers physical activity largely related to raw speed and strength. Long jump, high jump, sprinting and weightlifting are all covered by Athletics.


```
Examples:
Attempting to outrun something.
Shouldering a door open.
Carrying heavy weights.
```


**Grip**

Grip encompasses hand strength and your ability to hold on to things. Climbing, holding, squeezing, and crushing are all covered by Grip. Grip can also be used by animals and monsters in several ways, an alligator death roll or a T-Rex crushing a fence with its jaw would all fall under Grip.


```
Examples:
Dangling from a rope.
Climbing the wall of a castle.
Crushing something in your hand.
```


**Swim**

Swim covers all situations where characters are attempting to move in liquids. It is also applicable to science fiction settings in Zero gravity environments. Swimming may be more difficult if a character is wearing heavy clothing or resisting conflicts at the same time, at the narrator's discretion. While the skill is quite linear in function, the cost of failure in these situations is more often than not fatal. Uniquely amongst the skills, failing a swim check differs depending on whether you have assigned skill points to it. If you have, narrative failure applies as normal, with your character making no headway, treading water or otherwise. However, if you have not been assigned any points to swim, your character slips underwater and begins drowning.


```
Examples:
Swimming across a river.
Diving underwater to search for something.
Floating from one solar panel to another while repairing a space station.
```


**Throw**

Throw covers the physical task of launching objects from yourself, and successfully receiving them. The ancient arts of shotput and discus are the domain of the Throw skill.


```
Examples:
Throwing a Dwarf from a cliffside to a stone bridge.
Catching a sack of stolen goods dropped from above.
Throwing a grappling hook over a high ledge.
```



##### Reflex-Based Skills

**Perception**

Perception is the art of detecting things through sight, sound, and or scent, it can even cover “gut feelings” or intuition. It is used as the defence against deception, persuasion, and stealth; it will be common for the Narrator to require players to make environmental “Perception Checks” to gauge how much the characters notice regarding current happenings or places, whether obvious or subtle. While intellect can be vital in perception, it is the speed at which one notices things that can turn the tide in one’s favour. It is important to note many types of skills may commonly be used to assist with perception, especially vocational ones.


```
Examples:
Checking an area for traps.
Finding the right contact at a nightclub (Assist with Infiltration)
Locate a vendor for a particular item in town (Assist with General Knowledge)
```


**Acrobatics**

Acrobatics covers movements requiring agility and finesse as well as balance. Parkour, backflips and walking tightropes are all the domain of Acrobatics. Acrobatics is also the skill used for dodging things and avoiding traps or pitfalls.


```
Examples:
Performing a gymnastics routine.
Diving out of the way of a speeding car.
Weaving through security lasers.
```


**Ride/Pilot**

Any time a creature wishes to take passage on something the Ride/Pilot skill can be used. Riding a horse, driving a car/cart or surfing a wave would all be considered Ride/Pilot checks. When the ride skill is chosen the player must choose what type of animal or craft it applies to. The check should only need to be made if an active effort is required to maintain control. A person riding a train would not need to make a Ride/Pilot check, but the driver would. Clinging to a giant as it walks would be a grip check unless you were in control and directing its movement.


```
Examples:
Piloting a spaceship.
Steering a raft.
Driving a horse and cart.
```


**Sleight of hand**

Activities that require highly dexterous control of the hands are covered by Sleight of Hand. While more obvious tasks such as picking pockets come to mind, the skill also covers things such as weaving a small basket or threading a needle.


```
Examples:
Taking something small and fiddly apart successfully.
Picking a lock.
Performing a magic card trick.
```


**Stealth**

Sneaking, hiding from others and moving with no noise forms the basis of the Stealth skill. Stealth can be used for setting up ambushes and laying traps. Stealth is often countered by Perception, and the two forces of hide and seek clash constantly.


```
Examples:
Hiding in the bushes awaiting a caravan to rob.
Moving silently on a rooftop and staying low out of sight.
Approaching a predator from downwind to avoid it catching your scent.
```



##### Intelligence-Based Skills

**General Knowledge**

General Knowledge is the art of listening to rumours, recalling information and applying it where it is needed most. It aids in many tasks while being very specifically only usable on non-specialized tasks. A general knowledge check could never allow you to know how to disarm a bomb, but it might be able to tell you that to disarm a bomb you need to cut a specific wire. Which wire? You have no idea, perhaps if you had a Vocational Skill related to explosives you might know more.


```
Examples:
Getting a general grasp of who holds power in a region.
Knowing what trade goods are usually imported to or exported from an area.
Broadly understanding how to approach a situation, and what skills you might need on your team to be successful.
```


**Deception**

Deception is used to mislead others. This can be done in a variety of ways, from complicated disguises to outright lying. Deception also covers forgery and wilfully sending the wrong impressions through body language. An important thing to note regarding deception is that the knowledge of the person you are trying to deceive/persuade should affect the CL of the roll. Even with this caveat, some things are simply impossible to lie about. You could not convince someone you were their wife or husband for example. Instead, succeeding even against impossible odds often leads to the listener believing that YOU believe what you are saying, which can lead to some very unexpected outcomes!


```
Examples:
Lying about why you are somewhere you aren't supposed to be.
Disguising yourself as someone else.
Faking an emotion or fake crying.
```


**Infiltration**

If stealth is the art of going unseen, Infiltration is the art of going unnoticed. Hiding in plain sight or making the right social connections to ease into a niche social circle are equally valid uses of Infiltration. Infiltration also covers the ability to know and track patrol routes and weak points in defences.


```
Examples:
Slipping your egg into another bird's nest to have it rear your young, unnoticed.
Weaving your way through a social web until you reach the contacts you seek.
Avoiding mapped guard patrols to slip through a gap in their defences.
```


**Persuasion**

Persuasion is the art of convincing people of your point of view. Persuasion can be used in innumerable ways, but bartering, charming people and making sound arguments are the primary focus of the skill.


```
Examples:
Bargaining for a cheaper price on an item.
Convincing the town guard to give you information to help solve a murder.
Inspiring a boost in morale in a defeated force.
```


**Survival**

Survival is the skill associated with staying alive in all environments. It covers scavenging for food, basic first aid as well as finding safe places to rest and lighting fires. In the city, survival keeps you from going too close to dangerous gang territory, it lets you know who to avoid, and where to avoid. In the wilderness, it tells you which berries will make you sick, which meat is spoiled and more.


```
Examples:
Preparing an animal to be cooked.
Splinting an injured limb.
Collecting rainwater using leaves.
```



### Vocations

Vocations represent the path your character has walked up until the beginning of the game. They may continue to travel down that path, or may change going forward, but these vocations reflect the life they led and the career they chose.

Vocations in cogent roleplay are chosen in much the same way as Core Skills, and use skill points taken from the same pool during character creation. However, unlike Core Skills, Vocation selection should be discussed with the narrator before being finalised.

When selecting a Vocation or Vocations, a player must choose a career. These should be fairly specific, but must always represent a Job as opposed to a task or activity. For example, a player could choose to be a Chef, but not “cooking”. The player has the freedom to pick almost any vocation, but can’t pick all-encompassing metagame vocations like, ‘God’, or ‘master of everything’. It has to be a logical and pre-established Vocation fitting within the game world the Narrator has prepared

Selecting at least one Vocation is **Mandatory** and as such you get **1 free skill point** to assign to your first vocation. If you wish for your character to be unemployed, life goals or ideals are also suitable choices – “Drifter” or “Murderer” are perfectly fine selections for a Vocation. They are meant to reflect the path your character walks and the skills and talents they have learned within it. Essentially vocations can be seen as the character class component of Cogent Roleplay. A vocation can be many things such as classic fantasy character classes like knight, druid, wizard, ninja, soldier or more mundane vocations like blacksmith or baker. Much like core skills, Vocations can be applied to anything. Even a Lion would have a vocation such as “Plains Predator.”

Once you have chosen one or more Vocations, the player and narrator should agree on an appropriate Core Attribute to apply to each Vocation. This attribute is the one added to dice pools for your vocation.

Vocations are unique among Cogent skills. They cannot be used to make Skill Checks. A Vocation is essentially an ‘assist’ skill, meaning in most situations, it can only be used to make assist rolls to other skill checks or combat rolls, and only if the vocation has a logical and obvious association with the skill or combat roll you are trying to assist (and is approved by the Narrator).

With a Vocation chosen, you may now select up to four skills to write underneath the vocation.

These may fall under two categories. **Vocational skills** and **Combat Skills**. These skills can be determined by the player but must be agreed upon by the Narrator. In **Campaign Play**, you do not need to select all of these skills at character creation, with empty slots able to be filled later as you earn skill points. Both Vocational Skills and Combat Skills must be checked and approved by the narrator, and they must make logical sense as talents learned in pursuit of the chosen vocation they nest under. For example, you could not choose the combat proficiency “Heavy Ballistic Weapons” if your chosen vocation was “Nurse”. However, you could take “Small weapons” to reflect deft hands with needles or scalpels.

You can assign up to four points to any Vocation. You can also assign up to four points to any Vocational Skills or Combat Skills. However:

**You may never assign more points to a Vocational Skill or Combat Skill than you have assigned to its parent Vocation.**

(EG: A player with Vocation: Chef and two points assigned to it may not assign a third point to its Vocational Skill: Cooking, until they have first assigned a third skill point into Vocation: Chef)

Finally, Vocations, Vocational Skills and Combat skills may NEVER be assigned a negative skill point at character creation.


#### Vocational Skills

These skills showcase the unique talents and specialized skills you have learned while following the path of your chosen vocation. They are always allowed to be used for assist rolls, but may only be used for direct skill checks if that check is not better represented by a Core Skill. Using the example of Vocation: Hunter, here are some example Vocational Skills:



* **Tracking:** When a Hunter comes across tracks, they will be able to (in order of difficulty); follow the tracks, know their target destination, identify the species, or identify their health
* **Wild Craft:** This skill grants the Hunter the ability to use materials in the wild to build traps, shelter, wooden spears, and other tools used to survive in the wilderness long term.

These skills can be extremely specific, and while their function can be linear, it is designed to allow the players' skills to open up opportunities that would be impossible for untrained characters. For example, without a Vocation such as “Computer Specialist” and the Vocational Skill “Hacking,” it would be impossible for a player to know how to perform the task.

Much like the Vocations, they are nested in, players and narrators assign the Core Attribute for EACH Vocational Skill, this means it is possible to have a Vocational Skill with a Core Attribute that differs from its parent Vocation.

For example: Vocation: Warrior (Strength) may have Vocational Skill: Battle Tactics (Intelligence)


#### Combat Skills

Combat skills are selected as part of the Vocations they were learned in. They differ from other skills in two extremely important ways.

They must be selected from a predetermined list of options that correlate to a type of weapon modifier in cogent. These are:


##### Melee



* **Unarmed:** Martial Arts, and “Hand” weapons like knuckle dusters
* **Small Weapons:** Knives, Daggers, Saps, and other easily concealable weapons
* **Medium Weapons:** Backup/Personal protection weapons like shortswords, or clubs
* **Large Weapons:** Secondary battlefield weapons like Maces, Longswords, and Flails
* **Reach Weapons:** Primary battlefield weapons like Polearms


##### Ranged



* **Short Stringed:** Small ranged weapons including blowguns, throwing weapons, and hand crossbows
* **Long Stringed:** Standard medieval battlefield ranged weapons, like bows and crossbows
* **Hand Ballistic:** Pistols, and Sub-Machine Guns
* **Shoulder Stocked Ballistic:** Standard battlefield firearms like Muskets, and Assault Rifles
* **Heavy Ballistic:** Machine Guns, Cannons, and other Siege weapons

The second important difference is that Combat Proficiencies are the only skills that can be used in Combat which are covered in full detail in Chapter 3, Combat. Combat skills also accommodate things like supernatural abilities (magic or superpowers. If there is to be magic within a campaign setting, a player may need to specify a sub-type of magic as a Vocational Skill or Combat Skill by spending points on it to be able to use it in-game (see CH4, “Narration” and CH7, “Example Magic System”.)

If your game is using a Magic system or similar (IE: Superheroes), consult with the narrator to determine applicable Combat Skills as they will not appear on the lists above. Further guides on establishing magic settings and how to balance them as Combat Skills can be found in Chapter 5: Narration. An example magic system can be found in Chapter 7: Supplementary Content.


### Disabling Characteristics

Playing as an ‘unstoppable fighter’ can be less satisfying than playing an average fighter who struggles to beat a strong challenge. The greater the challenge a player overcomes, the more satisfaction the achievement. This concept also applies to characteristics. Often, disabling characteristics can create a richer and more entertaining character.

Taking on such a disabling characteristic does restrict the way in which you’ll play your character in-game, that’s why they are called disabling characteristics. It will make your role-play more challenging and thereby more satisfying. However, because such characteristics are restrictive, it’s only fair that the player who chooses to have one for their character receives an equivalent bonus. This bonus is also in place to encourage players to take on such characteristics who wouldn’t do so normally.

If you choose a Disabling Characteristic from the table below or create one that the Narrator approves, you will receive one additional Skill point to spend on character creation.

Alternatively, you may roll a twenty-sided dice, the resulting number corresponding to the table below, and take the Disabling Characteristic associated. This cannot be taken back. If you choose to roll for a Disabling Characteristic you must keep it! It will forever be a part of that character. In doing this you will receive two additional skill points to spend.

A player may apply (or roll for) as many disabling characteristics as they want unless the Narrator stops them past a certain point. However, you will only receive bonus skill points for the first TWO disabling characteristics you take (whether selected, rolled for, or in combination).

You don’t need to take a characteristic listed on the table provided, you’re free to make up whatever disabling characteristic you can think of, and your Narrator will decide if the characteristic you have chosen is disabling enough to receive the standard bonus given in the rules.

Disabling Characteristics should always be chosen or rolled before any points are assigned to Skills, otherwise often you may find that a disabling characteristic might utterly disqualify a skill you have chosen. For example, it’s obviously hard to use the skill deception if you have the Disabling Characteristic, ‘Can’t Lie.’

Narrators should also be aware that it is possible for the player characters to overcome many disabling characteristics through the narrative of the story. A character whose life was saved by a species which they have an extreme prejudice against might rightly have their prejudice soften or even go away. These evolutions of character should feel earned and justified, they are important moments and should be treated as such.

SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH – Disabling Characteristics

Following is a list of 20 disabling characteristics a player may roll for, including detail:

Many of these characteristics are open and vague, leaving it up to the Narrator to define specifics, provide definitions, examples and penalties.

Some of the following disabling characteristics cause an increased cost of certain skills during character creation. These are marked with an asterisk. ( * ) If an attribute is marked, all skills that use it as their core attribute suffer the cost increase. This further increases the importance of selecting or rolling for disabling characteristics prior to assigning skill points during character creation.



1. **Missing a bodily extremity/limb \
**The obvious example is that the character could have lost their hand or foot, but this may also include another extremity such as a nose or a reproductive organ.
2. **Feeble** (-1 to all **Strength*** based skills and **Strength** Checks) \
This may mean the character is malnourished, genetically weak, or maybe the result of an injury. The character is far weaker than a normal person.
3. **Heavy** (-1 to all **Reflex*** based skills and **Reflex** Checks) \
The character may be big-boned, have lots of muscle, or be excessively overweight.
4. **Dim-witted **(-1 to all Intelligence* based skills and Intelligence Checks) \
A result of a bad head injury, or the character may simply be stupid.
5. **Phobia \
**This is a debilitating fear that the character possesses that is to be selected by the narrator and can range from heights to spiders or little children.
6. **Extreme prejudice \
**Against a** **Species, culture, sexual orientation, political affiliation or religion. The Narrator is free to be creative, for example, making the character want to kill every person that supports a specific sports team or hold irrational hatred for those who wear anything with ribbons.
7. **Compulsive liar \
**This characteristic needs to be played in the right way – the player shouldn’t lie about everything to the point that it’s impossible to hold a conversation with them. Generally, it would be about anything concerning their achievements or anything that would give them an advantage no matter how small, like claiming the gold coin a character found on the ground, or inventing feats of heroism to impress locals.
8. **Kleptomaniac \
**Kleptomania is not necessarily the desire to steal but rather a compulsive need to have most things they see for reasons other than personal use or financial gain. Many of the items a kleptomaniac steals are useless to them and the item’s value does not weigh in on their compulsion at all, thus most items a kleptomaniac steals are worth very little.
9. **Paranoia \
**The extreme belief that every person they meet will eventually betray them, that the government is run by an evil cult or perhaps that stepping on a crack in the pavement will cause their death.
10. **Over-emotional **(specific emotion) \
An over-emotional character has a specific emotion that causes significant issues for them. It could be an inability to control their anger that senses them into senseless rages, or perhaps an incapacitating and incontrollable grief that is triggered when being reminded of past trauma. Extreme joy can be equally problematic, a character who simply cannot contain their constant joy and enthusiasm would make fast enemies at an important funeral.
11. **Very Forgetful \
**This does not mean forgetting everything to the point that the character is an unintelligible drooling oaf. This characteristic can manifest in such ways as a character always forgetting where they are and getting lost all the time, forgetting plans, directions or instructions. They might never be able to remember the names of people, towns or countries, or they may constantly forget where they put their items.
12. **Short Temper \
**A character with a short temper will react out of proportion to the norm when angry. The subject of the characters’ short temper may be broad (they are generally angry – the ‘Ebenezer Scrooge’ type), or specific (small animals make them furious!)
13. **Overconfident** (cannot spend points on an applicable skill during character creation) \
You are extremely overconfident in a specific skill, such as stealth, and will feel that you’ll always succeed in any activity using it. You will readily resort to any method that can employ the said skill and volunteer to use it whenever the opportunity arises. That unfounded confidence has caused no effort to be spent actually learning or training in the skill.
14. **Incapable of Lying** (specific parameters required) \
This is not a blanket restriction, the character will be able to lie, but not in circumstances the narrator specifies – such as not being able to lie to a certain gender. It might also mean a character can’t speak any ‘untruths’ but are still able to mislead people (like the Aes Sedai in “the Wheel of Time” novels.) It may also mean the character has a very prominent physical tell whenever they lie such as sneezing or farting.
15. **Addiction \
**This is not simply a preference for a certain thing, it is a disabling addiction, something that the character has withdrawals from if the addiction isn’t satisfied often. The addiction itself can include things like sex, drugs, specific foods, or even murder.
16. **Delusion \
**Your character truly believes something to be real beyond the scope of simple faith. They see and hear and feel that belief in their own reality. Examples: having an imaginary friend, hearing voices, or honestly believing that pot plants are secretly an invading alien race.
17. **Imperceptive** (-3D6 to environmental **Perception*** rolls) \
Your character is withdrawn, paying little heed to the world around them as they move through it. They could be a daydreamer or a shut-in, but either way, they are the sort of person most likely to walk out onto a road without looking, oblivious to the danger.
18. **Gullible **(-3D6 to **Perception*** rolls VS **Deception**) \
Liable to believe what is told to them, a gullible character is terrible at detecting lies and motives and generally believes in good faith that what they are told is true. While they can tell particularly outlandish lies, they’re at a significant disadvantage detecting good ones.
19. **Impressionable** (-3D6 to **Perception*** rolls VS **Persuasion**) \
Easily convinced by friends and trusted allies, even by regular folk. Impressionable characters are easily convinced to take particular paths to action and easily convinced to lend a helping hand to those who ask for it.
20. **People Pleaser **(Overly Agreeable/Yes person) \
Your character will do whatever they can to make other people happy, often at the expense of their own happiness or goals.


### Destiny Points

In Cogent we want you to create a character that feels real and has motives, desires, goals, flaws quirks and opinions. We feel that the more in-depth your character is, the more you will be drawn into the game you are playing. As a type of reward system to encourage this, Cogent Roleplay implements what we call Destiny points, which should be awarded to players for exceptional role-playing.

A Destiny Point represents the character’s influence on fate, their place in the universe and how their will may affect it. It can be spent in either one of two ways:


##### Before any roll of a dice pool.

A character may spend a Destiny Point before any d6-based roll, usually a particularly important one if they’re using their points wisely, which will give them a special destiny advantage in the roll. Instead of the usual 4-6 on a d6 being considered a win, each dice that rolls a 3 or higher will be considered a win, meaning 3-6. This increased the chances of rolling winning dice considerably but does not guarantee it, there is still a chance of failure.


##### After any roll of a dice pool.

A character may spend a Destiny Point after any d6-based roll to add a single win in addition to what they achieved. They may do this multiple times on any roll or separate rolls, for as many Destiny Points as they have.


#### Awarding Destiny Points

In **Fast Play** every character starts with 3 Destiny Points at character creation (unless the Narrator says otherwise). This is also the maximum number of destiny points a player can have. During **Fastplay** games award one destiny point roughly every three hours of play as a baseline. During **Campaign Play** destiny points are awarded at different rates depending on the tier of play. The narrator may also award players additional destiny points throughout the game for exceptional role-playing. Examples range from the player doing something that works towards their character’s goals, when they achieve something significant, or they do something, particularly in line with their character’s personality even if it was at the detriment of their wealth or progress.


### Commerce Points

The commerce point system is optional and the Narrator can choose to use it or resort to a traditional numeric method (keeping track of the number of dollars or gold coins a player has earned or spent.) The Commerce point system provides an easier way to govern the commerce of your games without the need to constantly calculate purchases and total currency amounts.

Below is an item value system that ranges from 0 to 8 that is to be used by the narrator to help calculate the value of any given item in the game.

Characters and NPCs have a “Commerce Level” that defines how wealthy they are in a given setting. This level is set during character creation in collaboration between the player and narrator.

Players can purchase any item that has a value score equivalent to, or less than, their total commerce points. Purchasing an item/service with a value equivalent to your current level of commerce points will subtract/cost 2 commerce points from your total pool.

Purchasing an item/service with a value equivalent to 1 point less than your current level of commerce points will subtract/cost 1 commerce point from your total pool.

Purchasing an item/service with a value equivalent to 2 points under or less than your current level of commerce points will not remove any points from your total pool – unless purchased in large quantities or regularly.

One way to think about it might be like this:

Purchasing an item with a value equal to my level of wealth, will cost a lot of my total finances (such as someone with a high income [4 commerce points] buying a nice home [lvl 4 purchase, costing two commerce points], reducing their financial status to ‘commoner’ [level 2] after the purchase is made.)

This ratio of cost for the specified item values is present because commerce points go up exponentially in value. If item values need to be compared to one another, for a general guide their values can be thought of as 1 of 10 going up, or 10 of 1 going down. EG: 10 bodyguards (each with an item value of ‘4’) might equate to the value of a Private Security Force (item value 5.) This is an example, but we recommend players use this mechanic as a guide rather than a means of precise valuation.

This means that the third commerce point is essentially worth ten level two commerce points and the fifth commerce point is worth one hundred level three. The narrator needs to take this into account when awarding commerce points as going from 2 to 3 commerce points is infinitely easier than going from 5 to 6.


#### Assigning Commerce Points

At the conclusion of character creation, the Narrator should assign a commerce level of Two, Three or Four to the character based on backstory. Characters can gain additional skill points, showing their need to adapt under harsh conditions or display interesting quirks that come along with wealth.



* If the character is assigned a commerce level of **Two**, they gain **+1 skill point** to spend on their character, but may only spend it in a skill they have not already assigned any points into. (Note, this can be a vocation or vocational skill as yet unfilled).
* If the character is assigned a commerce level of **Three**, they remain as they are.
* If the character is assigned a commerce level of **Four**, they must roll on the **‘Quirks of Wealth’** table at the end of this section. (Player and Narrator can instead agree upon a backstory appropriate quirk if they desire)

At this point, the player may then opt to increase or decrease their commerce level by one point.



* If they **decrease** it, they gain **+1 skill points to** spend on their character, but may only spend it on a skill they have not already assigned any points into. (Note, this can be a vocation or vocational skill as yet unfilled).
* If they **increase** it, they must roll on the **‘Quirks of Wealth’** table at the end of this section. (Player and Narrator can instead agree upon a backstory appropriate quirk if they desire)

This may only be done once, and the player can instead opt to ignore this step and accept the commerce level the Narrator assigned them. At the end of this process, the player will be left with a commerce level of between ONE and FIVE.

In **Fastplay** games, the Narrator can of course choose to ignore these recommendations for their game, but it is strongly recommended to support an enjoyable game experience for everyone. Gaining resources is often a very important motivator and plot driver in tabletop RPGs, and one especially wealthy player can very quickly render that moot with a high commerce level (six to eight). (For example, a commerce level six player purchasing extravagant weapons and full plate armour for their entire party upon arriving in the first town to no detriment.)

Players will gain commerce points throughout gameplay which will be assigned by the narrator as a reward for quests (as the narrative dictates) either through the flow of narrative (finding treasure) or role-play (selling loot to shopkeepers.)


#### Quirks of Wealth Table

If you roll twice due to the narrator assigning you a Commerce Level of four and then choosing to increase your Commerce Level by one, Re-roll the second result if the narrator deems it incompatible or if you roll the same result twice. (EG 1 + 5/6)

## How to Play


### Introduction to Dice Pools


#### Introduction

The first thing that is needed prior to playing is a group of players. Once you have gathered some friends and determined who is going to be the Narrator, the Narrator will begin planning the story and the players will build their characters. This will be covered in more detail in Chapter 2 (Character Creation) and Chapter 5 (Narration). But before you can launch into your adventure, it is important to understand the core mechanics of Cogent Roleplay. While Cogent is a ‘Roleplay First’ system, the mechanics facilitate the stories that you tell, and as such have been designed to be easy to understand as well as robust and universal.

Throughout this ruleset, you will find rules presented for **Fastplay**. This refers to most games of Cogent Roleplay where a group picks up and plays for one or a few sessions. Modifications to the standard game rules can be found under **Campaign Play** in Chapter 5: Narration. These modifications mainly cover character creation stat distribution and awarding character advancements during play. If a listed rule references how it operates in **Fastplay** and is not modified in the rules or by the narrator for **Campaign Play**, assume the **Fastplay** method still applies.


#### Dice Pools

Dice rolls in Cogent Roleplay fall into two categories, unopposed Actions and opposed Conflicts, both requiring the player to roll a group of dice known as a Dice Pool.

Cogent Roleplay uses traditional six-sided dice for its gameplay, known colloquially as **D6**’s. (D indicates “Dice” and the 6 refers to the number of sides.) When making any roll in Cogent, you gather a group of **D6**s together and roll them as a group.

Your dice pool is determined by the stats on your character sheet and is made up of three parts. The exact type of roll you are required to make will be called by the narrator, and will always be linked to a skill on your character sheet. (EG: General Knowledge.)

Let’s look at forming the Dice Pool you will use in every roll you are required to make while playing a game.

Step 1: **Add Base Three**: Your dice pool always starts with 3 dice. This represents the capacity for an untrained person to always have some ability to attempt any given task. These core three dice are included in every single check and are often referred to simply as your ‘base three’.

Step 2: **Add Core Attribute**: Core Attributes represent the natural talents and capacities of your character. Each skill you are using is governed by a Core Attribute, you also assign points to these attributes during character creation. Any points assigned to a relevant core attribute are also added to your dice pool. The skills on your character sheet are grouped under their relevant attribute. (For example: Infiltration has “Intelligence” as its Core Attribute. If you are making an Infiltration check, you would add any points of Intelligence you have marked on your character sheet to the dice pool.)

Step 3: **Add Skill Points**: Skill points represent the specific knowledge and practical skills of your character. When being asked to make a check to attempt a task, one of your 15 core skills or any of your vocational skills will be used. When creating characters, you assign points to these skills as you see fit. These points correspond to dice that you add to dice pools. (For example: If you had an ‘Infiltration’ skill with 2 points assigned to it, you would add 2 dice to your dice pool in this step).

Step 4:** Apply Modifiers**: Finally, occasionally during games your character will have modifiers to their dice pool, whether via injuries, unique characteristics or situational penalties. The modifier will be a number, and that number represents how many dice you add or remove from your dice pool.

Note: It is entirely possible for a character to have negative points in a skill or attribute, if this is the case, instead of adding dice to the pool, subtract them at the relevant step.

_Example:_


```
The Narrator asks Rob to make an "Athletics" check. Rob's character has 2 points in Athletics, and 1 point in Strength.  Since the Narrator didn't declare there were any Modifiers, Rob rolls 6D6 (Base Three + Strength + Athletics ± Modifiers).
```


Now that you understand how to form a dice pool, it is time to move on to how those dice pools are utilized and what they are rolled against.


### Actions and Challenge Levels

When a player wishes to undertake a task within the game against something that cannot intentionally resist, it is referred to as an Action. Examples of this include:



* Climbing a wall.
* Balancing on a tightrope.
* Recalling information.

This action is completed by rolling your character-relevant **Dice Pool** against a static ‘**Challenge Level’**, or **‘CL’**.

When a player character chooses to make an action within the game, the Narrator can assign them a CL based on the difficulty of what they will attempt to perform, as well as indicating which skill should be used for the task – the more difficult the task, the higher the **CL**, ranging from **1** (a common task) to **8** (inconceivable!).

With the challenge level set and the skill indicated, a player can form their dice pool as described in the previous section. Once formed, they roll their dice pool in an attempt to beat the **CL** of the task.

The characters’ statistics (see Character Creation’) will determine the number of dice that can be rolled against the CL. Each dice represents a 50/50 chance to gain a **win** or **loss** towards the **CL** (unless a Destiny Point is used, see Destiny Point.)

![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


_On a traditional 6-sided dice (or ‘D6’) any dice roll that shows a 1-3 is considered a loss, while any dice that shows a 4-6 is a win._

To pass the **Challenge Level** you must roll enough **wins** equivalent to, or greater than, the set **CL**.

_Example:_

_Your character wants to climb a wall and the Narrator assigns this task a **CL** of **3**. You have five dice to roll which means at least three dice must achieve a **win** to succeed against the **CL**._

   </td>
   <td><em>Narrative Success of 0</em>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The more dice a player has to roll against a **CL**, the higher the chance they will succeed.

SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH - Challenge Level (CL) Difficulty Scale


#### Assigning CL and Skills

For every action the players wish to perform, it’s the Narrator’s job to assess each request and judge how difficult such a task would be. As well as this, it is the Narrator’s responsibility to set the skill that the player will be using for this challenge. While often a player will suggest a reasonable skill and the narrator will be happy to go with that choice, the final decision of the appropriate skill is up to the narrator.  

Often, the skill selection will occur organically at the table.

**Challenge levels** are assigned to any task that has a reasonable chance of failure. The more difficult the task, the higher the **CL**. These **CL** ratings are classified as follows:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Task</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Challenge Level</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Common Task
   </td>
   <td>CL 1
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Uncommon Task
   </td>
   <td>CL 2
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Specialized Task
   </td>
   <td>CL 3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Difficult Task
   </td>
   <td>CL 4
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Extremely Difficult Task
   </td>
   <td>CL 5
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Unrealistic Task
   </td>
   <td>CL 6
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Virtually Impossible Task
   </td>
   <td>CL 7
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Inconceivable Task
   </td>
   <td>CL 8
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Using these classifications, they choose an appropriate skill alongside the player and assign the **CL**.

In this example, a player is chasing a thief across rooftops in a busy city. The narrator describes the scene, a wide road separates the player from their quarry, the gap is large, but the street is a bustling bazaar littered with shade sails and guide ropes.


```
Player: "I would like to cross from my rooftop to the other side of the street"

Narrator: "Ok, how would you like to go about this?"
Player: "I wish to get a run-up and leap!"

Narrator "Sure, you charge at the ledge and jump! Make a CL 4 Athletics check to cross the large gap"
```


_Alternatively_


```
Player: "Can I balance on guide ropes and dart between shade sails to get to the other roof with my acrobatics?"

Narrator: "Certainly! Make a CL 4 acrobatics check to keep your balance as you cross"
```


In this example, the challenge level was roughly equivalent, but in this negotiation process we see how multiple skills can be used to achieve the same result, and often the CL for each approach will be different depending on the skill use.

Below are some examples of CL’s a Narrator might choose to assign to various tasks. Each Narrator is entitled to make their own judgements on how difficult a task is, and CL’s will often vary between Narrators, campaigns, task circumstances and game sessions.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Example</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Challenge Level</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Climb a rope 20 meters in the rain
   </td>
   <td>CL 4
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Do a triple back-flip
   </td>
   <td>CL 5
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Ride a horse without a saddle
   </td>
   <td>CL 3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Override the console of a basic spacecraft
   </td>
   <td>CL 4
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Catch a flying arrow
   </td>
   <td>CL 6
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Lift a car
   </td>
   <td>CL 7
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


A narrator may be tempted to assign a higher or lower CL to a more capable character because such tasks would be easier to them based on their skills. This is not necessary as CL’s should always be assigned based on how difficult the task would be to a regular person in that setting. It is a character’s skills (or lack thereof) that will affect their potential to succeed in action – not an altered CL.

However, CL can differ based on the approach to action, even if the outcome is the same. A player who attempts to open a crate with a toothpick would have a higher CL than the same character attempting to open it with a crowbar.

Now that you understand Dice Pools, Actions and Challenge Level, we can look at an example roll in detail

_Example_


```
A character attempts to pick a lock – the Narrator assigns a CL of 3 (a specialized task) and determines that Sleight of Hand is the appropriate skill. The player is happy with this and doesn't offer an alternate approach.

The player forms their dice pool by adding their Base Three (3D6) to their Sleight of Hand skill. The player has two points in Sleight of hand (2D6). Finally, the player notes that Sleight of Hand uses Reflexes as its Core Attribute, and adds one point in Reflexes (1D6).

The player rolls their Dice Pool (6D6) against the CL. The players' roll is successful if the number of wins is equivalent to or greater than the CL assigned to the task.

They score four successes, and the narrator describes their success, the lock is open!
```



#### Skill Specialty

Once someone has specialized in a given task enough, they can perform its simpler and more routine functions with ease. Once your dice pool for a given skill check is equal to or greater than **EIGHT** you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill when asked to make a check for that skill with a Challenge Level of **THREE** or less, you automatically pass if all of the following conditions are true:



* You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influence or aggression such as combat.)
* The check is not a contested check.
* The check is not a reflexive action.

NCE: CHSH - Active/Passive Notes


### Reflex Actions and Conflicts

Situations may arise in which a player must respond reflexively to a threat, which may have the potential to harm or injure them. In these situations, the Narrator will tell the player to respond in a specific way, which will vary based on the threat.

Generally, reflexive actions can be used in places where other systems might ask for a ‘saving throw’ but they can also be used where players have an obvious physical cost associated with failing to achieve something. For example, navigating hostile environments.

In the context of these checks, after rolling to meet the **CL** required, if you failed, ascribe injury to a character based on the difference between the number of **wins** scored on your roll and the number of **wins** required to meet the **CL** of the action. (within the context of the level of danger the task entails.)

_Example:_


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Challenge</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Roll</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Result</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>An “Acrobatics” check while falling from a dangerous height
   </td>
   <td>6D6 vs CL 4 and 3 wins
   </td>
   <td>The character missed the CL by 1 and receives a level 1 injury (see <strong>Injury </strong>under <strong>Combat</strong>)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>A “Survival” check to find food in the wilderness
   </td>
   <td>7D6 vs CL3 and 4 wins
   </td>
   <td>The character successfully finds food
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>An “Endurance” check to resist the effects of an ingested poison
   </td>
   <td>7D6 vs CL 6 and 3 Wins
   </td>
   <td>The character missed the CL by 3 and receives a level three injury (see injury under combat)
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



#### Conflicts

A conflict occurs when an action is taken against another character that can actively oppose it. Conflicts may arise in various forms, such as combat, arm wrestling, seduction, or sneaking up on someone. Both parties involved will be required to make a roll, using their dice pools based on relevant narrator-assigned skills.

Within conflicts where all characters are considered aware and active, rolls that are tied/equal are simply re-rolled.


```
Examples of conflict that involves multiple active opponents:
An Arm wrestle
Combat
A foot race
Bartering with a shopkeeper
```


In some situations, rolls that would usually be conflicts may instead be assigned a **CL** by the narrator. This is usually only necessary when the character that would oppose the conflict is completely powerless to do so by normal means. For example, sneaking up on someone having a meal would be a conflict, but if they were sleeping and unaware the narrator could instead assign a **CL** to reflect that. As a general guide, the **CL** of such a check should be lower than half that character's dice pool. This method should only be used for players acting on **NPCs**, and never the other way around.

Most Conflicts are simple and require each character to make one roll. When conflicts take several rolls to resolve (such as in combat) the conflict is conducted in a Round by Round format.

SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH.2 – Active/Passive Notes


### Success and Failure

Something crucial in Cogent Roleplay is how success and failure can be treated.

In Cogent, success can be seen as fairly straightforward, if you meet the desired challenge level your action succeeds as expected. But there is scope to increase the effectiveness of the success if the player beats the **CL** of a task by a significant amount. This is often used in scaling checks, most commonly used with the perception skill.

The Narrator can opt to set a task with a minimum **CL**, where additional successes achieve greater results. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">This can be any **CL** they wish, but if they do not set a **CL**, it is assumed to be 1.</span>

_Example:_


```
A player asks to look around a crime scene to get their bearings. The narrator sets the CL at 1, with a total score of 1 ensuring the player gets a basic rundown of the scene, but the more they beat the CL, the deeper and more significant the information they find becomes.
```


In many ways, these scaling checks can be seen as the inverse of reflexive actions. They usually apply to perception, but the narrator may choose to award similarly beneficial results to other types of checks.

_Example:_


```
A player asks to pick a lock. The narrator sets a CL of 3. The player has a dice pool of 6 and amazingly scores 6 successes. The Narrator declares that the player so deftly cleared the lock that they realized they are familiar with the exact maker of the locks in the jail, and can confidently pick any more that remain. They then state the player automatically passes all further checks related to picking that type of lock in this location.
```


When it comes to failure, most often people think of the Literal Failure of the task – Failing to pick a lock means… well, you failed to pick a lock. Dice rolls are most often interpreted this way, and are standard practice in many PnP RPGs.

In addition to Literal Failure, Cogent Roleplay encourages the use of two methods of story progression, Narrative Failure and Failing Forward.

Only rarely is a path of action truly misguided enough to lead to no narrative outcomes, and this is the area that literal failure should apply. Sometimes, a magical runic lock just needs the correct magical phrase to breach, and nothing else will do. These can be important narrative foils to get players moving toward concrete goals and should serve to advance the story by directing player focus rather than grinding it to a halt. If you find a challenge is grinding the game to a halt unintentionally, it is time to move on to Narrative Failure or Failing Forward.


#### Narrative Failure

Narrative Failure doesn’t mean that the action itself failed, but rather the desired outcome is not obtained.

_Example:_


```
If a player is trying to sneak into a walled city and fails the assigned CL, a Narrative Failure might mean that they still climbed the wall (as intended), but are greeted by a guardsman at the top of the wall (… clearly not the desired outcome!) It might also mean when they crest the wall they knock off a loose stone which crashes to the ground below, making a VERY loud noise.
```


If the player’s roll produces only losses and no wins, this can be considered a critical failure. The narrator might have the wall fall over while the character is clinging to it, crushing the king who just so happened to be walking by on the other side in front of countless witnesses.

Narrative Failure may provide interesting avenues of storytelling, and add loads of fun. Of course, sometimes Narrative Failure just doesn’t fit or a Literal Failure makes more sense. Alternatively, there is a third avenue open to moving forward.


#### Failing Forward

In instances where literal failure will cause the story to grind to a halt and narrative failure seems inappropriate, it is time to Fail Forward.

Failing forward differs from the other two methods of progression because both the intended action failed AND narrative failure didn’t allow them to achieve their desired outcome even with downsides. So how do we move forward?

Failing forward is what happens when the negative or failed outcome itself leads towards a NEW path forwards. In the example of the attempted wall climb above, if for example, it seemed so unrealistic that the party could climb the wall at all, and their roll was that poor, perhaps they are caught at the base of the wall by the guard(s) who arrests them on suspicion and takes them into custody in the guardhouse.

The guardhouse just so happens to be on the other side of the wall.

Now the situation is dire, and a bad outcome has occurred, but the narrator has replaced one problem the players were unable to resolve with a new equally interesting narrative situation and a new set of challenges. Should the players escape their custody, surely new consequences await, but they will be free on the other side of the wall they had been trying to cross.


### Assists

Core Skills, Proficiencies and Vocations can all be used to perform assist rolls. An assist roll is a roll player can make to (potentially) gain additional dice to aid their primary action/objective. Assist rolls are made before the action in which the player wishes to receive the assist. Assists may be applied to any logically applicable roll – and the player must first ask the Narrator if the assist roll is appropriate.

If the player is in a position where a skill they possess would logically assist or grant an advantage to another skill or combat roll (whether their own or another player’s) the Narrator can assign a Challenge Level (**CL**) based on the difficulty of the assist.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The **CL** for assists starts at three and should never be lower than that.</span> However, it is up to the narrator to decide if it should be higher than three. In general, most assist roles, unless extremely unlikely to aid the current situation, will be made at **CL** three.

If the assist check was successful, additional wins are added to the result of the skill or combat roll the player has assisted – equivalent to the number of wins achieved OVER the Assist **CL** in the assist check

_Example:_


```
3 wins against an assist CL of 3 does nothing to assist the following action, but 4 wins will grant +1 win to the result of the assisted action's roll.

On the other hand, if a player achieves only 1 win in an assist roll of CL 3, the player will then face a penalty of -2, to be deducted from the result of the assisted action's roll. This means that any assist can backfire, and as such carries an element of risk.
```


Each player can only attempt 1 assist each round. This means that if a player has 2 skills that could logically assist another skill check or combat roll they must choose between those 2 skills.

The number of wins gained or losses subtracted from an assist can never be greater than the challenge level of the assist. For instance, you can only ever receive an additional 3 wins or losses to a skill or attack that you’re trying to assist if the assist check was **CL3**. Likewise, an assist check with a **CL4 **will add a cap at max 4 wins or losses depending on the outcome of the assist check.

Every skill, vocation, vocational skill and combat skill can be used for assists, provided it is logical and the narrator approves it.

_Example Scenario:_


```
You wish to make an acrobatics check (CL 4) but the CL is one point less than the total number of dice in your dice pool (5D6), a hard check to make – however you also have two points in the vocation 'martial artist'. The narrator approves of your quick thinking and allows you to roll to perform an assist to your acrobatics skill check.

Your total Martial Artist vocation dice pool is 7D6 and the narrator sets the assist at CL 3. You roll five wins total, meaning you will now receive +2 wins toward the result of your following acrobatics check.

The acrobatics check is CL 4 and as previously mentioned your dice pool is 5D6. You roll four wins which would mean a loss if not for your assist, providing +2 wins making a new total six, meaning through using an assist you have succeeded a difficult Challenge Level!
```


Within Cogent Role-play, we don’t outline every applicable situation where a given skill can be used. It’s up to the players and the Narrator to negotiate how these skills can be logically applied to different circumstances.

Having said this, if you are acting as the Narrator you will find that players will try for some very thin connections between a given skill they possess and the situation they are in to attempt a skill check or a possible assist. The players must feel free to express their logic to the Narrator and the Narrator should listen to all requests fairly – cooperative negotiation is something that the players and narrator should engage in as it helps the narrative reach new creative levels – but in the end, it will be the narrator’s call and the players must accept what the Narrator decides.


#### Helping Others

Thus far, assists have only been described when used by the player to assist themselves with another skill. However, players are free to use assists to help (or unintentionally hinder) others as well. In this instance, it is up to the narrator to determine if it is possible for someone else to assist, and if so, how many people can attempt to assist. This limitation is usually drawn from what would make narrative sense. It would be nigh impossible for someone to assist in a computer hacking check if the person hacking was using the only computer available. However, if a second or more computers were on hand, it would make logical sense that others could attempt to aid the player in rolling the hacking skill check.

In most situations, when multiple players are attempting to complete the same skill check to achieve the same task (eg: investigating a crime scene) the narrator will call on them to decide who is the primary actor in this situation and who is assisting, rather than each player making a separate skill check. Usually, the exception to this is when multiple players are making physical skill checks to perform a highly individual activity at the same time. (EG: Climbing a wall). While they are all attempting the same type of skill check, they are not attempting the same task, as each is rolling to climb up the wall as an individual, not a group. They succeed and fail alone.


#### Single Person Assist

When assisting a single player, first you need to determine if they want your help at all. We recommend playing this scene out in character, and offering your assistance, most of the time they will be open to the idea, however, occasionally an overconfident or strong-willed character may refuse. At this point, it is up to you to decide if you will heed their wishes and help or refrain from helping. You are free to ignore what the other player wants and attempt to help regardless IF the narrator allows it. Some tasks, such as looking for items, investigating, and checking someone’s vital signs can all be done by multiple people at the same time, however other tasks are impossible to assist with without consent. Remember, your assist roll can help OR hinder, so beware that these kinds of forced assists can cause friction between characters. This can create amazing narrative tension and be very true to the character, but try not to do it if it is irritating the other players at the table.

If you assist in this way, it functions identically to assists for a single character. You roll a skill assist and the active person making the skill check adds wins or subtracts losses from their roll based on your assist roll.


#### Group Assists

As previously mentioned, as many people can assist with an activity as the narrator deems sensible or appropriate. This could be none, one or fifty. It is the narrator’s role to make it clear how many people can helpfully assist. While in general, there is always a chance that an attempt to aid a situation will backfire, when greater numbers of people pool their efforts, the average begins to swing in the favour of aiding the situation. Assign a player who is making the skill check, then, assign another player who is assisting and what skill they are assisting with. Each additional player adds a single dice to the dice pool of the player making the assist roll.

_Example:_


```
Gary is trying to recall if there are any back-alley weapon traders in their local area. He goes to make a General Knowledge skill check, when Lucy offers to aid with her Vocation (Street Thug). The narrator deems it more than suitable to assist in this kind of check, and offers that anyone present that has spent significant time in the area has a chance of adding more information. The two other players, Bill and Ted, both say they wish to assist.

Mechanically, Gary is making a General Knowledge skill check. Lucy is making a Vocation (Street Thug) assist. She has a Dice Pool of 6D6, but with Bill and Ted assisting, her dice pool is increased to 8D6 for this roll (One dice added per additional player assisting). Lucy rolls and scores 6 wins, this beats the assist CL3 and adds a total of 3 wins to Gary's General Knowledge skill check. Seems like Lucy's time on the street paid off.
```


Note: Characters, action economy and trust: In reality, in a functioning party, most of the time people will trust each other to complete their assigned roles. If you are directing your parties’ horse and cart, and another player is composing a song in the back of the cart, you will be relying on the characters you have entrusted to act as lookouts to do their job and have no reason to suspect they cannot. Oftentimes, the narrator will disallow assists based on the fact that your characters are already actively doing something else. In this situation, assisting a perception check to look out for danger may be limited to the number of players not actively engaged in other activities.


### Player/Narrator Negotiations

Cogent is a flexible system with purposeful provision for interpretation and adaptability. We’re not going to spell every single thing out for you (like specifying each and every circumstance where a specific skill can be used to assist another skill, or spelling out every possible vocation you’re allowed to pick.) If we did this we feel it would make the game system restrictive and complex, which would result in a worse game by the end.

You’re smart and we trust you to see ways in which certain aspects of Cogent can benefit your character, in things such as skill interaction, assists and combat modifiers.

However, because every person is an individual, they’ll very likely see different ways certain things in the game can be interpreted and thereby how they feel it should affect the gameplay. This is wonderful and we encourage every player and narrator to explore their creative ideas as it enriches and enhances the gaming experience.

In these situations, it becomes important to familiarise yourself with the process of friendly player/narrator negotiation. If you as a player honestly feel that your character should receive a bonus, such as an additional dice to roll with, because of some kind of in-game circumstance, you should feel free to suggest this to the narrator. Narrators shouldn’t feel defensive if a player makes such suggestions – this is a great thing and shows how engaged your players are in your game. Try to give fair consideration to every suggestion or request a player puts forward. We’re not saying you have to agree to everything, only to give honest consideration to such suggestions, and explain why you disagree if you do.

Players, if the narrator disagrees with you, once you have presented your argument, it is then your responsibility to accept the Narrator's decision and don’t argue further! That’s when the role-play experience gets much more frustrating, so if you feel the Narrator is giving you “lemons”, just try and make “lemonade”.


#### The Narrator shouldn’t hold your hand, be creative to survive

Even in the most hopeless situations, clever thinking can achieve a great deal. Don’t just rely on your character statistics to win conflicts in your game. Remember you are creating a story with your friends, so approach everything in the game in a narrative way. Don’t just say “I attack”, describe how you are attacking, and think outside the box every once in a while, and a good Narrator will reward clever role-playing.


#### Roleplay can progress the game as much as combat (negotiation, lying, buying etc)

An entire role-play session can be very rewarding even if a single combat dice aren’t rolled. The main element in a role-playing game is role-playing, not combat, so don’t expect to fight every time you play. There are plenty of other challenges and dice rolls that will need to be done outside of combat and never think that combat is the only way to get out of sticky situations. Remember the key is to do what your character would do, so if your character would resolve most conflicts through combat, then go right ahead, but there are many other character types to play other than battle-focused adventurers, and they can be just as enjoyable.




## Combat


### Combat Fundamentals

When a character’s life is on the line, every asset they possess is brought to bear in order to win. Thus every attribute; strength, reflex and intelligence, can be added to the combat roll.

Combat Dice Pools are calculated by adding:



* Base **3D6**
* + **1D6 **for each Attribute point (**STR**/**REF**/**INT**)
* +**1D6** for each point in any **Combat Skill** (Relevant to what the character is wielding or doing)
* + Any applicable** weapon bonus**

_Example:_


```
Sir Terrik the Knight has challenged another knight to a duel. He has the vocation "Knight" and nested under that vocation he has taken the combat skill "Medium Weapons" to showcase his prowess with the sword. Terrik's Dice Pool is calculated thus:
Base of 3D6, plus +1D6 from STR and +1D6 from INT
2D6 from his two skill points invested in the "Medium Weapons" Skill  (which can be applied as he is wielding a medium sword)
+1D6 from his arming sword (the bonus for a medium weapon)
His total Combat Dice Pool is 8D6.
```



#### Victory Levels

A successful combat roll results in a level of **victory** against your opponent(s). Your combat roll stands as both an **attack** and **defence**. It represents your character’s overall combative performance for that round and not necessarily a single ‘swing’ of their weapon.

Each character’s combat roll is compared to that of the character(s) or non-player character(s) they oppose. Every **win** a character has over another’s roll, means a **level of victory**, from which they may choose an outcome.

SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH - Victory Levels


##### Level 1 Victory



* Minor Injury, the opponent receives **-1D6** to all physical-based dice checks but will naturally heal over the next few days, or faster if treated actively. This can be negated by strength or armour.
* Stagger (-**2D6** for one round)
* Enter into **close combat** (not available to ranged combat rolls)


##### Level 2 Victory



* Medium injury **-2D6** to all physical-based dice checks and must be treated relatively soon, otherwise further penalties may apply (infection etc.) – this can be reduced by strength or armour to a lower injury or fully negated.
* Disarm
* Any lower outcome


##### Level 3 Victory



* Serious injury **-3D6** to all physical-based dice checks and the character will die in time if the wound is untreated. This can be reduced by strength or armour to a lower injury or fully negated.
* Trip
* Any lower outcome


##### Level 4 Victory



* Fatal injury **-4D6** to all physical-based dice checks, incapacitated, and will die very soon if untreated. This can be reduced by strength or armour to a lower injury or fully negated.
* Knockout Blow – Render your opponent unconscious, and apply a Medium Injury to the opponent in addition.
* Dismember an arm or leg, which also gives a serious injury to the opponent. (not available to ranged combat rolls unless magic or explosive projectiles are involved)
* Any lower outcome


##### Level 5 Victory and Higher



* Deathblow. An** instant kill **unless the character has high strength and or is wearing armour and uses them to reduce either the level of victory or injury.
* Any lower outcome

Injury levels do not stack in fatality but do stack in dice penalty – meaning two medium injuries do not equate to a fatal injury where the character will die immediately if untreated, but the character does receive -2D6 to all physical dice checks TWICE, meaning they will have -4D6 in total.


#### Defence rolls

A Defense Roll is a variant of the Combat Roll. It is used when a character is either in a position where they cannot perform any type of Combat Maneuver to their opponent (E.g. too far away from an opponent using a ranged weapon against them while only armed with a melee weapon), or they want a greater chance to survive as their standard Combat Roll is too low (such as fleeing after receiving an injury.)

A Defense Roll is calculated in the same way as the Combat Roll but adds an additional +2D6 to roll with. No matter the result of the Defense Roll, the character cannot achieve a level of victory because the character was purely focused on protecting themselves, and not on attacking.


### Combat Actions and Timing

Combat is run in a Round by Round format. Each character can perform 1 action within a round (usually a combat roll) with liberties in regard to the narrative flow of the game. For instance, it doesn’t take an action to shout out something to another character while fighting a monster, though it would take a round to explain something complicated.

The narrator must not time a player’s dialogue to make sure it falls within restrictive timing. Remember narrative flow will make things run far smoother if you are a little relaxed in regard to things like this, while still having limits – you wouldn’t want to let a player pass on huge amounts of information in a single round, in the middle of a battlefield. In those cases, you might say something like, “it will take several rounds to explain everything you want”.

Round by Round combat isn’t played using any grids, timers, boards or miniatures, though sometimes a rough map or drawing of a room or location may help. There isn’t a strict distance character can move within a round, this is left up to the Narrator’s and the player’s own reasoning. A player with a higher REF would be able to run faster and farther than another player with less, and it doesn’t take that much thought to figure out how far a person can run within a round.

Actions in combat rounds are not solely movements and attacks. A combat action can really be anything a person could do within a few seconds, such as turning over a table, swinging from a chandelier, or dropping a boulder onto an enemy. The Narrative flow you develop while playing will guide you in what the players can do in-game, and how long it will take to do it.


#### Round Order

Every action within Round by Round conflicts happens almost at the same time or in direct succession of one another. This means that one character’s action is NOT explicitly followed by another character’s action. It should be considered as everything happening together.

To make sense of this potential ‘chaos’, there is a declaration phase and a performance phase.

SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH - Combat Priority Guide


##### Declaration Phase

The Character with the lowest reflex declares what they are doing first. That might seem odd as you could think characters with higher REF should get to move first – but this is the declaration phase – no one is moving yet. If two Characters have the same REF, they each roll 1D6, where the highest resulting roll gets to declare later for the rest of the combat encounter.

Players who declare LATER hold an ADVANTAGE in combat.

Once a player has declared what they are going to perform, they cannot change their mind. They are locked into performing that action in this round. The players who declare after another can choose an action that counters or complements the declared action of another character.

This means that characters with the highest Reflex can see or react to what their opponents are going to do.

_Example:_


```
Leon, a player character, is duelling Dartane, a non-player character. It's a new combat round and Dartain has a lower Reflex than Leon so he must declare his action first.

Dartain declares that he intends to jump on top of a table to get a height advantage against Leon, readying for his attack on the next Round. Leon, knowing Dartain's intent, declares that he wishes to knock the table over whilst Dartain jumps on top of it.
```



##### Performance Phase

Once all characters have declared their action, they make their rolls. Though things mostly happen simultaneously within the round, it’s sometimes important to know which blade landed before another, or who managed to perform their action a little bit faster than another. In these situations, the character with the higher reflex will always win.

_Example:_


```
The Narrator decides that it will be a standard combat action for Leon to knock over the table but Leon won't receive his weapon bonus for this action as he is using a rapier which isn't suited for knocking over tables (if Leon was using something heavy like a greataxe, it could be used to smash down on the side of the table to knock it over and the weapon bonus might be appropriate.)

Leon's roll is a base of 3D6, +2D6 for his points in Reflex, making 5 dice to roll with in total.

The player controlling Leon asks the narrator if he can apply his acrobatics skill. The narrator agrees, giving Leon a further +2D6 (7D6 total).

Leon rolls his 7 dice, resulting in 4 wins. These 4 wins become the CL his opponent, Dartain, must match in order to succeed his declared action and remain on his feet.

The Narrator instructs Dartain to make an acrobatics check to jump on the table. Under normal circumstances (unopposed) this would have been easy, requiring a CL of 1, but now Dartain must make an acrobatics check against CL 4, quite difficult for a skill check.

If Dartain succeeds in his action, he will have an advantage in the next round of combat (higher ground), but if he fails, he will have a disadvantage (staggered, or prone, depending on the roll, see Combat Modifiers).
```


Where “declaration” happens in reverse (slowest players declare first), during “performance”, the order is reversed, and players with the fastest Reflex in that encounter act out their intentions first.


### Armour

armour can be used to reduce injury level (not victory level, which only Strength can reduce.) Wearing lots of armour will also add weight which negatively affects a player’s combat roll.

Armour levels are set by the type of armour the character is wearing, described below. In the case of shields, the armour rating stacks with worn armour. A character wearing a full plate (4 armour) and using a large shield (2 armour) will have an armour rating of 6. This is the highest armour rating in the game, but will also remove -3D6 from their combat roll

PLEASE NOTE: Injury reduction from armour is not applicable while in Close Combat (See **Combat Modifiers**)

</table>


A character can reduce injury levels by the equivalent amount of levels they have in armour, per combat encounter. When another fight begins (another combat encounter) the character’s pre-set injury reduction from their armour level is reset.

_Example:_


```
Victoria is a noble knight and is attacked unawares by a backstabbing rogue.

The rogue achieves a level 3 victory and chooses to inflict a serious injury. Victoria is wearing full plate armour and can reduce up to 4 points of injury throughout this conflict.

Reducing this serious injury by 3 points times will negate it; one to reduce it to a medium injury, a second to reduce it further to a minor injury, and another to remove the injury entirely.

Victoria chooses to do so, which will leave her one last injury reduction from her armour for that combat encounter, but enable to fight without such a disadvantage. She will however, be fighting with -2D6 to her combat roll due to her heavy armour.
```


When achieving a victory in combat you can choose to inflict an injury – but if your opponent is wearing armour choosing to inflict an injury will be more easily countered through their injury reduction. However, other actions chosen through a victory, such as staggering, disarming or tripping an armoured opponent, cannot be negated with armour (see Combat Modifiers, CH4, PT7.)

For a more sophisticated approach to the armour rules within Cogent Roleplay, please see Chapter 6: Hardcore Combat


#### Endurance and Armour

A character with high endurance is considered much more capable than average of functioning with heavy armour on. As such, for every point in the Endurance skill (NOT including the base 3D6 or any strength modifiers) the negative to the combat roll is reduced. A character with 1 point in endurance will not receive -1D6 to their combat roll for carrying a small shield or wearing a padded gambeson. A character with 4 points in endurance can wear full-plate mail and carry a large shield and receive the benefits of damage reduction that come with armour, without any of the negative combat modifiers.


### Weapon Modifiers

Each weapon inherently provides advantages over other weapons. The following is a guide and can be altered as the Narrator sees fit.

For a more sophisticated approach to the weapon modifiers and ranged combat rules within Cogent Roleplay, please see chapter six: Hardcore rules

SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH - Ballistic Modifiers


### Fighting Groups

As mentioned, a character’s combat roll stands as both offence and defence. If a character is acting offensively against **several** opponents at once, in one round they are able to engage against the equivalent of half their total combat roll, rounded down. This can mean that larger weapons (which grant a greater bonus to combat rolls) make it easier to defend against, or attack and hit, multiple opponents.

Ranged weapons usually cannot achieve victories against more than one opponent per round (this is dependent on setting and allowances from the Narrator, for example; a fully automatic machine gun can hit multiple opponents in a single round, see Hardcore Ranged Rules, CH6.) However, a ranged combat roll still stands as a defence against more than one incoming attack; indeed any character can defend against a number of opponents in a single round.

_Example:_


```
Sir Terrik is fighting two goblins. Terrik has a combat roll of 8D6. This also means that Terrik is capable of defending against, and achieving victories against, a maximum of 4 adjacent opponents in a single round.

The two goblins he has engaged each have combat rolls of 7D6 (calculated from base 3D6, +2D6 REF, +1D6 from medium swords proficiency and +1D6 from their medium weapons.)

One of the goblins rolls 4 wins and the other rolls 5 wins.

Terrik rolls 4 wins.

This means that he matched one of the goblin's rolls but was beaten by the other. The Goblin chooses to inflict a minor injury with its level 1 victory against Terrick.

The next round Terrick rolls 6 wins with his recalculated combat roll (a total of 7D6, due to his injury inflicting -1D6), and the goblins each roll 3 wins.

Terrik achieves a level three victory against both goblins and he chooses to inflict a serious injury to each.

As a serious injury will kill a character if not treated in the near future, the goblins retreat leaving a trail of blood.
```



### Melee vs Ranged

The advantage with melee is that your single offensive combat roll can inflict injury to several opponents that did not match your combat roll.

The advantage of ranged fighting is that no combat manoeuvre can be performed against you so long as your opponent is not adjacent to you. Melee combatants, no matter how high their combat roll, cannot inflict injury unless they are close enough. One common disadvantage with many ranged weapons is that no matter how high your combat roll, you can only inflict injury on one opponent each round.

Guns and bows are meant to be used at range and don’t perform well in melee combat. If a character using melee weapons wants to engage in combat against an opponent using ranged, the character with the ranged weapon will incur the standard penalty as described in weapon modifiers, but not right away. The character using the melee weapon must close the distance and the narrator will determine how many rounds this will take (it might not take any rounds if the character is close enough.)

In the first round where the Melee combatant gets to attack, the ranged combatant might still not receive the ascribed penalty, if they have a higher reflex.

If the melee combatant has a higher reflex and is close enough they can close the distance to a combatant using a ranged weapon before they can fire. In this instance, the ranged combatant received the appropriate penalty for using ranged weapons in melee combat. Also, the combatant using the ranged weapon can only injure the melee combatant attacking them if they declared that they were aiming for that combatant in the declaration phase (they might have been aiming for another person), for ranged weapons can only achieve victories against one opponent in a round.

If a ranged combatant was aiming for someone else, their attack can still hit whoever they were aiming for with no reduction to their roll, but when comparing their roll against anyone attacking them in melee combat, their combat roll is reduced by the weapon type.


### Combat Modifiers

There are many circumstances in combat where a player would logically receive either a bonus or penalty to their combat roll. Below are some examples of standard combat modifiers and if a player feels they should receive a bonus that is not covered by the following suggestions they are free to request the bonus from the Narrator and the Narrator will make the final choice. Likewise, the Narrator is free to impose a penalty not covered in the following examples if they feel it is applicable.

SEE CHEAT SHEET REFERENCE: CHSH - Combat Modifiers


#### Dual Wielding

Dual wielding does not give an additional combat roll in a round. What it does is grant an additional dice bonus depending on the weight of the second weapon being used. To duel wield the character must have at least one proficiency point in both of the weapons being used to receive any bonus.



* **Small secondary weapon**
    * +2D6 to all combat rolls
* **Medium secondary weapon**
    * +1D6 to all combat rolls

**_PLEASE NOTE_**: If you are dual wielding, your combat roll is made up using the proficiency and/or weapon bonus of your primary weapon, NOT any proficiencies or weapon bonuses for BOTH weapons.

_Example:_


```
Kelvin wields a Rapier and a Dagger. His attack role is made up as such:
Base of 3D6, plus +1D6 from INT and +1D6 from REF
2D6 from his two skill points invested in a Medium Sword Proficiency
+1D6 from his rapier weapon bonus (the bonus for a medium weapon)
+2D6 for the dagger he is also wielding (this bonus can ONLY be added because Kelvin has at least one point in the Small Weapon proficiency)
If Kelvin were to be disarmed from his primary weapon in combat, he will lose any dual wielding bonus, and must revert to the dagger as his primary weapon until his rapier is recovered.
```



#### Close Combat

‘Close combat’ means the fight is so close in physical proximity that the character’s bodies are pressed up against each other in a grapple or wrestle. Being in close combat negates the use of larger weapons and thus the weapon bonuses of any weapon, medium and larger, are lost when in close combat.

In this scenario, a character using a medium (or larger) weapon is considered ‘unarmed’ and as such will receive any applicable penalties.

Entering into close combat is a manoeuvre which minimally requires victory level 1.

Injury reduction from armour is not applicable while in close combat.

Additionally, you can use a medium weapon in close combat if your opponent is using a reach weapon.

_Example:_

A troll charged Marcus with a combat roll of 6D6, +1D6 for the charge.

Marcus, being aware of this due to his higher Reflex, will brace against the attack with his combat roll of 7D6.

The troll rolls a total of 4 wins, and Marcus rolls a total of 3 wins, +2 additional wins due to his high reflex allowing him to brace against the charge. If he were slower to react, Marcus may have been injured in the charge, but due to bracing he is now able to either stagger or injure his opponent.

PLEASE NOTE: You may further reinforce your 'brace' by making the entire action 'defence', gaining a further +2D6, however no victory levels can be achieved in doing so
```



### Chases

Chases are far more common than you might think. Just watch any action movie and see if there’s a chase scene (there usually is.)

In Cogent, chases begin with the Narrator setting a distance level out of 3 categories for the characters in the chase, those being a close distance, medium distance, or long distance.

At a Close Distance, the characters engaged in the chase are relatively near each other, but not near enough to engage in combat without ranged weapons. Narrators must keep ‘relativity’ in mind when deciding on a level of distance – a Close Distance in a car chase might be considered far away for a chase on foot.

When on foot, the characters use the athletics skill to make chase rolls

When using a vehicle (including mounts) the characters use their ride/pilot skill.

From the initial distance set by the narrator, the players roll against each other using the applicable skill (athletics or ride/pilot.) Please note that other skills, vocations and proficiencies can be used to assist the chase role, such as using acrobatics to jump and weave through obstacles to lose your pursuer.

If the pursuer wins the chase roll, the distance between the characters is reduced. If a pursuer wins the chase roll against the target at a close distance, the pursuer ‘catches’ those trying to flee.

If the characters trying to flee win the chase roll, the distance between them and their pursuers increases until a successful roll at a long distance, whereupon the characters have successfully fled.

When the distance is closed, the target trying to flee were literally stopped, IE their horse can be tripped over, dismounting the target, or their car was run into a tree or wall, damaged so it no longer functions – or they ran into a corner with no easy escape or they were tripped up and are now prone.

The level of severity in how the characters were stopped will depend on how severely they failed the final chase roll. The narrator might even use a destiny roll to determine how bad.

Narrators should use chase scenes as an opportunity to bring excitement to the narrative. Be careful not to let chase scenes become a simple turn-by-turn scenario of “you get closer” or “you get farther away”. Instead, describe the obstacles, and make them difficult and exciting.




## Narration


### Fundamentals of Narration


#### What is a Narrator?

In the context of Cogent Roleplay, the Narrator is the storyteller. They perform a function similar to that of a Dungeon Master or Game Master in other game systems. However, Cogent Roleplay focuses more heavily on group storytelling than many other game systems, so in a way, the role of the narrator is one of facilitating that story through the creation of the majority of the worlds and characters the players will encounter and explore.

One way to look at it is that the Narrators set the scene, fill the scene with extras and then prepare the stage for the actors to perform their play. As a narrator, you facilitate gameplay, role-play as various NPCs, arbitrate disputes and establish a plot that the players engage with. It is a role with a very wide range of responsibilities, but do not let that dissuade you. The rewards for being the narrator are numerous, and it is an extremely satisfying role to fill.


#### How do you become a Narrator?

In general, there are more people who desire to be players than narrators of stories, so as an aspiring Narrator it should not be too hard to convince people to let you give it a shot. All you need to do is have an idea of a story you wish to tell, or a setting you wish to play in, and pitch it to your players. From there, a lot of it is learned by doing. There is no simple method to becoming an excellent narrator for the simple reason that what everyone values in a narrator is different. A legendary narrator in one playgroup may be considered a bad fit for a different one. This is why seeking to establish a good dynamic at the table as players of a game is critical to having an easier time narrating games. While there are no catch-all solutions, here are some simple tips to make your first game as a narrator easier.



* Talk to your players: Discuss the style of game they wish to play, and ensure everyone is happy with the choice. (Eg: A roleplay-heavy dark story, A crime thriller, political intrigue or combat dungeon crawls)
* Facilitate a group character creation session: It will make your first games infinitely easier if the party isn’t constantly on the verge of fracturing and splitting. Run a group character-building session and encourage bonds between player characters that reach into their history, cementing them as a group with a logical reason for being together.
* Don’t compare yourself to others: It is important to remember that every journey is different and every story is worth telling in its own way. Focus on having fun as a group, and don’t get caught up on perceived performance.
* Offer controlled choice early: Bound your first sessions into smaller sandboxes. Limit player movement and choice but try not to limit their agency. You can control the options, but don’t force the decisions.
* Be ready to improvise and don’t cement too much: As a Narrator, it can be beneficial to have solid ideas of plot beats and character goals, but it is important to allow them to be flexible enough that the story can survive and sculpt around exciting player developments.


### The Destiny Roll

So far untouched in the text of this manual, the Destiny Roll stands alone as an extremely powerful and dynamic storytelling tool. A destiny roll is made by a 20-sided dice, or D20, and is made by the Narrator, or assigned by the Narrator to be made by a player.

This roll can be applied to endless scenarios and is used to allow the Narrator to let fate – the roll of a dice – decide what direction the story will move on in, be that for or against the player's goals and desires.

The higher the roll is, and the closer the roll is to 20, the more advantageous the result is to the player(s). Adversely, the lower the roll and the closer it is to 1, the worse the disadvantage. Furthermore, rolling a 20 is considered a critical success, and may allow the Narrator to assign exceptionally advantageous circumstances to the party or player. Likewise, rolling a 1 is always to be considered a critical failure, and will result in all kinds of things the players won’t want. Whether they be revealed as immediate or delayed consequences is up to the Narrator.

These rolls may be used in situations of great intensity, to help the Narrator guide the path of the action. They may be used to help break up the monotony at random times to see if something good or bad encounters the player, or even what the weather is (see CH7, “Random Encounter Tables”), and they may also be used to determine the intensity of consequence of a players choice.

Here are a few simple examples of the Destiny Roll in action

### Running Games


#### Running a One Shot

One of the simplest ways to get started Narrating is to run a self-contained single-session adventure. Often using Cogent Roleplay, this can be further simplified by diving into a familiar world or setting with friends! Using a familiar setting allows all the players at the table to innately understand a lot of the rules around how the world works, and lightens the load on the narrator. A one-shot is simply a short one-off story, it doesn’t always finish in a single sitting, but usually, that is the intent. Characters made for one-shots aren’t used later, so they can be a great chance to try new things and practice new avenues of roleplay for everyone at the table. During a One Shot, we recommend using the **Fast Play** rules and creating characters exactly as described earlier in the rules. Players typically won’t <span style="text-decoration:underline;">gain</span> skill points or even destiny points <span style="text-decoration:underline;">during</span> a One Shot, however Narrators should always reward exceptional roleplay with a destiny point, even in one-and-done settings.

 


#### Running a Campaign

Running a Campaign can be one of the most singularly rewarding TTRPG experiences one can have. The friends and stories made at the table can very much be lifelong, and the journey your characters go on will be remembered for years to come. As the Narrator, you are in the exciting position of being able to frame that story, the players act out and respond to all the mystery, intrigue or drama that you can throw at them. Campaigns can run for a short time; perhaps a half dozen sessions, but they can also run for massively extended periods. Campaigns spanning years or even decades are not unheard of, and the level of investment in the world is incomparable to one-shots. With this in mind, it is important to have, at the very least, a general idea of the overarching plot and story you wish to tell. Then loosely we can break up that plot into story acts.

A story act is a period of time in the campaign where the players encounter a larger issue or seek a goal and resolve it over the course of the game. This issue or goal should be significant, and scaling to the peak of a story act should be a significant occasion. Story acts can also be known as arcs, or perhaps seasons if you think of a campaign like a TV show. There are many different configurations to the overall story structure, but a very common one is the concept of “Three Acts”.   In the first act, players face some obstacles, both outside and inside the party, but overcome their local threats and come into their own. In the second act, they begin strong, but slowly things turn dire as a nasty villain’s plot becomes known. By the end of the second act, often characters have suffered a major loss or setback, and hope seems lost. The third act begins with our characters finding resolve, and challenging the enemy, ultimately cresting the heights of their potential and overcoming their greatest challenge. This is just one example of a campaign as it plays out as a representation of the most archetypal ‘three-act story’ you can craft. You do not need to craft your stories like this, but it offers a guideline or rough concept of how story arcs flow and each should build up to a satisfying conclusion. (Satisfying can be negative or positive for the player characters, so long as it serves the story)

Within a story arc there are multiple chapters or episodes. Traditionally in tabletop RPGs, these do not represent play sessions but rather quests or lesser plot events. You may cover a story chapter in a single session, or it may take three or four. These chapters serve as small milestones as your characters learn new things and move out into the world, slowly working towards the goal of the story's current arc (or season).

These terms are how we frame character advancement in games of Cogent Roleplay. There are no experience points to gain, instead, milestones players reach that show they have advanced their skills and talents.


#### Ways to Play

Several times throughout the Cogent Roleplay rules we have referred to Fast Play and Campaign Play, here in the narrator section we will go into depth about what it means.

**Fast Play** is simple, at its core, **Fast Play** is the basic form of the cogent rules. In **Fast** **Play** games, you can use everything presented here at face value. It is intended for shorter stories, one-shots or settings that might take place over a short space of time in the world, where character advancement doesn’t fit the story Narrators and players want to tell.

**Campaign** **Play** is a different beast entirely. **Campaign** **Play** is designed to allow for a rewarding growth of characters throughout a longer format storytelling game. It covers everything from episodic encounters with large time jumps to day-to-day heroes’ journey campaigns that could span years. **Campaign** **Play** applies restrictions to certain rules as well as guidelines on how often to reward players with different resources and skills. Nothing in **Campaign** **Play** is designed to change any of the core rules or features of Cogent Roleplay, instead, it offers a framework to allow players to feel a sense of growth and progression throughout their journey.

As a guideline, **Campaign** **Play** is split into three tiers, each representing a starting point for your characters. These tiers are **Initiate**, **Adept** and **Veteran**. Within each tier, stat distribution and reward recommendations differ. As a general guide, **Initiate** tier games start with weaker characters that progress more often, whereas **Veteran** games are the opposite.


### Campaign Progression

If you have decided to play a campaign, choose a tier of play that feels appropriate for the story you want to tell, this should be done in concert with the party, but ultimately the narrator makes the final call.



* If your adventurers are wide-eyed young adults leaving home for adventure for the first time, perhaps an **Initiate** tier game would be the most appropriate.
* If the party is a group of travelling adventurers, arriving in a new land from another place to take on quests and seek glory, **Adept** may feel the most appropriate.
* Or finally, the party may be the king's most trusted circle of knights, heroes in their own right, gathered together to face the greatest foe of an age. Then surely, a **Veteran** is the most suitable!

In the previous section, we discussed Story Arcs and Story Chapters. The campaign progression system uses those loose guidelines as benchmarks for how and when to award different bonuses. There are also modifications made to how many Attribute Points, Skill Points, Vocations and Disabling characteristics players may select at character creation. Finally, there is a special rule used in Initiate and Adept tiered games only, simply called a **“Career Milestone”**

**_The following modifications apply to character creation:_**


```
Starting Attribute Points: The number here replaces the amount of attribute points you get to assign in Fast Play games (Usually 2)

Starting Skill Points: The number here replaces the amount of attribute points you get to assign in Fast Play games (Usually 12)

Maximum Vocations: This number indicates the maximum number of Vocations you can select during character creation. (Eg: Chef, Wizard, Ranger etc)

Disabling Characteristics: This number indicates the maximum number of Disabling Characteristics you may take at character creation. (Unrestricted in Fast Play games.)
```


**_The following skill caps affect player characters until they reach story milestones:_**


```
Maximum Core Skill Points: This number indicates the maximum number of skill points you can invest in a single skill at character creation. (Unrestricted in Fast Play games)

Maximum Vocation Skill Points: This number indicates the maximum number of skill points you can invest in a single Vocation or Vocation Skill (Including Combat Skills) at character creation. (Unrestricted in Fast Play games.)
```



#### Initiate Tier

The journey of wide-eyed or inexperienced folk as they embark upon a campaign or adventure is often considered the most archetypal form of storytelling in TTRPGs. It can be immensely rewarding watching your character grow and soon find themselves able to easily thwart challenges that troubled them in the beginning sessions.

Initiate play is where a lot of long-form campaigns will start, due to its very limited distribution of skills and its rapid growth. Players will and should feel weaker or more restricted, but not more so than common folk. The Narrator should take extra care to ensure that early challenges are appropriate for lower-skilled characters. Dice pools will likely be no larger than 6 at maximum, so afford suitable opportunities for roleplay to carry the day.

**_The following modifications apply to your character and how they can advance. These are listed as the campaign progresses as your character becomes stronger, and wiser and hits milestones._**

##### Initiate Progression Guidelines

**First Taste of Glory:** Initiate campaigns should reward players with a skill point upon the conclusion of their first session or quest. Unlike most progression points, this does not have to be a significant enough event to call it a chapter, even slaying pesky rats in a cellar will do. Introduce the idea of growth early, and players will be engaged to keep growing.


##### Acts and Chapters in Initiate Campaigns

Due to the maximum cap on skill points that can be invested into skills, it is safe to award skill points relatively regularly, with players broadening their skill set rather than becoming “best of class” inappropriately early (to make sense in the story).

An Arc should have roughly 6-8 chapters within it, and each chapter should reward a skill point to spend upon completion. Ensure you also award a destiny point at the completion of each chapter as well.


```
At the end of the FIRST arc, increase the maximum CORE skill points and VOCATION skill points to 3.

At the end of the SECOND arc, increase the maximum CORE skill points to 4. Award an ATTRIBUTE point to all players.

From the THIRD arc onwards, award skill points every second chapter, rather than every chapter. Continue to award a destiny point every chapter.

At the beginning of the FINAL arc, award an ATTRIBUTE point to all players.
```


**Career Milestone:** At any point after the end of the **SECOND** arc, it can be exceedingly rewarding to involve individual character life motivations into the story. Come up with an individual quest or goal for each player that represents them entering the elite tier of their chosen life path. As each player completes this quest, increase their maximum **VOCATION** skill points to **4**.

Optionally, this can be done for each vocation a player has, with the maximum skill point cap lifting for the vocation they complete the quest for.

_Example:_


```
The troubled archer, Melesandra, has been plagued by nightmares of the beast that killed her family when she was young. After adventuring throughout the campaign, the players reach midway through the third story arc. Unexpectedly, in a small village, a group of townsfolk gossip about a great beast that matches the description of the one that took Melesandra's family. If she were to find it, and slay it… She would have conquered her demons and proven herself as an expert archer.
```


Should you choose not to use Career Milestones, instead increase all players' maximum **VOCATION** skill points to 4 at the end of the **SECOND** arc, along with **CORE** skills.


#### Adept Tier

  </tr>
</table>



##### Adept Progression Guidelines

**Local Renown: **Adept adventurers have already made a name for themselves, in the starting area of the campaign, players should have a reputation. They are more likely to be dealt with respectfully, and sought out for help.

**Starting Supplies: **Typically, Adept adventurers should have all the tools they need to go forth and adventure, horses and a wagon in a medieval campaign, or perhaps a small shuttle craft in a sci-fi adventure.


##### Acts and Chapters in Adept Campaigns

An Arc should have roughly 6-8 chapters within it, and each chapter should reward a skill point to spend upon completion. Ensure you also award a destiny point at the completion of each chapter as well.


```
At the end of the FIRST arc, increase the maximum CORE skill points 4.

At the end of the SECOND arc, award an ATTRIBUTE point to all players.

From the THIRD arc onwards, award skill points every second chapter, rather than every chapter. Continue to award a destiny point every chapter.

At the beginning of the FINAL arc, award an ATTRIBUTE point to all players.
```


**Career Milestone:** At any point after the end of the **FIRST** arc, it can be exceedingly rewarding to involve individual character life motivations in the story. Come up with an individual quest or goal for each player that represents them entering the elite tier of their chosen life path. As each player completes this quest, increase their maximum **VOCATION** skill points to **4**.

Optionally, this can be done for each vocation a player has, with the maximum skill point cap lifting for the vocation they complete the quest for.

Should you choose not to use Career Milestones, instead increase all players' maximum **VOCATION** skill points to 4 at the end of the **FIRST** arc, along with **CORE** skills.

##### Veteran Progression Guidelines

Veteran campaigns are slightly harder to progress due to already commencing near the pinnacle of human capacity. So exclusively in Veteran campaigns, it can be an interesting option to play with using the maximum number of destiny points as a new method of progression.



* It can be tempting to allow characters to grow beyond the restrictions within the core rules for humans, but we advise against it. Save those options for supernatural, magical or technological enhancements that can be obtained in-game.
* If your veterans are superheroes or similar, that is of course a different story. And it is up to the narrator to determine what those stat modifications will look like. Alternatively, you can look at some examples in Chapter 7: Supplementary content, for ideas.

Ask yourself and your players why seasoned and top-of-their-career veterans are setting out on an adventure, and what that means for the narrative.

**Reputation Precedes them: **Typically veteran adventurers are well known by friends and foes alike in a wide area, they should be treated as such by any NPCs that would know their names.

**Glory Days: (Are over?)** An optional rule for Veteran campaigns only. With much of their glory and success behind them, Veterans adventurers start the campaign as if they had “used up what luck fate had for them” They have a maximum destiny point pool of ONE. However, this maximum will grow every arc until it exceeds the usual limit of THREE, as fate proves to them they are the chosen heroes.


##### Acts and Chapters in Veteran Campaigns

An Arc should have roughly 6-8 chapters within it, and each chapter should reward a skill point to spend upon completion. Ensure you also award a destiny point at the completion of each chapter as well.


```
At the end of the FIRST arc, award an ATTRIBUTE point to all players. If using Glory Days rule, increase their maximum destiny points to 2.

From the SECOND arc onwards, award skill points every second chapter, rather than every chapter. Continue to award a destiny point every chapter.

At the end of the SECOND arc, if using Glory Days rule, increase their maximum destiny points to 3.

At the beginning of the FINAL arc, award an ATTRIBUTE point to all players, if using Glory Days rule, increase their maximum destiny points to 4.
```



### Narrator Tips

Many issues can arise at the table when running a TTRPG, and more often than not, it falls to the narrator of the game to resolve them. As players become heavily invested in their characters, emotions can run hot as things do not go as they expected. Beyond just interpersonal management, certain campaigns can cover heavy themes and go to dark places. Sometimes, exploring these aspects of the human psyche and experience can be immensely rewarding, learning experiences, but all things have an appropriate time and place. The following are some general narrator suggestions that can be used in your games, they aren’t mandatory by any means but offer some things to think about.


#### Honesty and Conversation are the Key

The golden rule when starting out a campaign is to have discussions with your players about what they want and what they can expect. It is perfectly fine to ask them in broad terms what style of game they want to play and to talk out as a group about what will be the most enjoyable for everyone.

During this discussion, asking questions of your players can help everyone at the table get an understanding of each other’s expectations. Set boundaries and restrictions. These aren’t right or wrong, they are all personal choices. Here are some examples of these ideas as they relate to roleplay that could come up in this sort of conversation:


```
No explicit content
No drug references
No in party "loot hoarding" or theft. (One might argue that it is "in character" to do so, but if it will upset or frustrate a player consistently in real life, then you shouldn't do it.)
Group unity (Players agree to create characters that naturally work together and don't fight often)
```


There are endless discussions to be had here, and it is much better to nip a problem in the bud before it arises than have to manage the fallout.


#### Mature Themes

When dealing with adult themes of any nature, you absolutely must be certain that you and the players are all ok with including them. Discuss this with your players, and discuss where the boundaries are. Even with such discussions, as a Narrator, you should offer options for your players to back out of any situation that makes them feel uncomfortable (even if they indicated it was ok prior)

_Example:_


```
"Red Card": Players and Narrator all have a red card they can deal to the table as soon as something becomes an issue for them. The scene ends. No questions asked. Roleplay picks up from the next appropriate location.

"Rewind": Players and Narrator can freely "Rewind" a situation by dealing a similar card. This can allow a narrator to choose a different approach to the situation. The previous encounter prior to the rewind is stricken from the record, and considered non-canon. Obviously this should be used for player protection, not character protection. This isn't a "get-out-of-character-consequences free card".
```



#### Player Disputes

Occasionally, players may feel that they have been treated unjustly by the game. They may question decisions or outcomes that occurred at the table. When this happens, it is important to listen to them and take their views into consideration. While ultimately the narrator makes the final call on arbitration, considering the outcome of what has happened in-game, and how the players feel about it. Sometimes, the player may be out of line, angry or being unfair, in these cases, it is understandable to let a ruling stand. But remember that TTRPGs at their core are a group of friends playing make-believe with each other, and if one player’s enjoyment has been completely taken away, it isn’t a good experience for everyone.  A potential solution to this is to ask the table how they feel it would be fair to resolve the issue. For example, if a player character died and they felt they had no chance to avoid the death, consider explaining the situation, and asking the group what they feel would be a better outcome for the story, perhaps their character is instead taken prisoner, or severely injured and in a coma. There are ways that can avoid an element of trauma while still ultimately requiring the player to create and play with a new character, but now the added story element of their last being missing or out of action can fuel story beats rather than hinder them.


#### Commerce

To help make the experience of buying/selling dynamic for players, a narrator might consider allowing the cost of the desired item to ‘drop’ by one level of value if they succeed in a ‘persuasion’ or ‘deception’ check vs. a vendor. Likewise, the item may also become more difficult to obtain if such a dice check is failed.

It is also worth considering what items are available and where. A small town in a medieval setting may have a farrier who can smith up some horseshoes, but it is doubtful that they would have the facilities or artisans to create full-plate armour of the highest quality. Introduce magical items into the mix and it complicates things further. Having towns with notable trades in your setting can make them feel richer and more memorable, as well as building stories within those areas easier. An example of this could be a town built by a cliffside with a rich vein of gemstones running through it offering a lucrative trade of such goods, while they may be far more scarce elsewhere.

A narrator may also decide to allow the players to use their destiny points in making purchases more attainable if this can be justified through narrative in a satisfying way. That being said, keep in mind that destiny points scale at a level of 1:1, while commerce points scale at a ratio closer to 1:10, therefore a narrator may decide it may cost a single destiny point for a level 3 item to be lowered to a cost of 2 commerce points to a player, but it might cost 2-3 destiny points to bring down the cost of an item valued at level 5-6.


### Custom Rules and Magic


#### Homebrew

One of Cogent Roleplay's greatest strengths is its simplicity and its adaptability. The core rules presented here are designed to be as flexible as possible and applicable to any setting you desire. However, should you desire more specific flavour and depth for a setting, you are encouraged to invent your own custom rules and homebrew concepts for that setting.

An example setting has been added to **Supplementary Content**, for you to use or use as inspiration, and more may be added in the future.


#### Metahuman (Magic and Superpowers)

The Vocation skill category is also to be used for supernatural, or metahuman abilities if the setting you’re playing in has any. (For the sake of simplicity, from this point onward any type of magic, superpower or sci-fi enhancement will simply be referred to as “magic”, and when referred to, it applies also to all supernatural abilities that could be added into any setting.)

Depending on the setting, the Narrator may have different options in place for how magic works, however regardless of the system your skill points will be invested in a Vocation to manage those powers. A rough example of what that might look like is shown below:

The following must be considered when a Narrator decides how the magic works in the setting:

Can anyone attempt to perform a spell even without the specific combat skill in the same way anyone can pick up a sword and try to use it? Remember that in both cases with the sword and magic, having no proficiency with them would result in many failed rolls. Can only people with at least 1 combat skill point in the magic use it?

Do you want magic to be more powerful than normal combat skills, or have it balanced? 

How encompassing do you want the magic to be? Is there a single magic proficiency or is it broken down into categories such as Earth, Air, Fire and Water, Sorcery, Wizardry, Witchcraft, Druidism, Necromancy, or Holy?

Is there a limit to the magic’s use? Can a player only cast a certain amount of spells a day or per combat encounter?


##### A Few Words on Magic and Weapons:

As was explained in the combat chapter, every weapon receives a weapon bonus depending on its type. This bonus stays when making any roll that uses weapon proficiency and generally results in more dice to roll with when using proficiencies than with skills. It’s up to the narrator if they wish to add weapon-type bonuses to magic proficiencies.

For instance, using a wand might grant a +1 die while using a staff might grant a +2. Alternatively, if the narrator does not wish to add weapon bonuses to magic proficiencies they might decide that the magic simply cannot be used without a wand or staff.

If weapon bonuses are added to magic proficiencies, the magic will then have the same amount of dice as other combat/weapon proficiencies – this might seem balanced but it may not be – It can potentially make magic more powerful than common combat/weapon proficiencies depending on the setting. A player can do far more with telekinetic powers than with a sword.

Ultimately, how this is balanced is up to the Narrator or the specific setting games that are being played in. Remember it is always critical to consider how game balance affects player experience, you don’t want your wizard outshining everyone else to such a degree that they feel useless. In a fast play Game, it might be a lot of fun to roleplay as indestructible superheroes or Greek Gods. In the case of a campaign it can be very frustrating for players to be the least powerful member of the group. Conversely, if a player is too powerful they may become bored by the lack of a real challenge.

A very simple solution to this is to split magic up into its subcategories and insist that players must be trained (have a skill point in a relevant vocational skill or combat skill) in order to attempt to use magic. This ensures magic users have access to powerful abilities, but require large sums of their skill points to be invested in one area, making them significantly less useful outside of those situations.

In the chapter: supplementary Content, we have provided an example magic system that can be used or adapted into various settings – or used as a model on which you may craft your own (see **Example Magic System**.)


### NPCs and Monsters


#### NPCs

Non-player characters are vital to stories told in any TTRPGs, they can be so memorable that players mourn their deaths and cheer their victories. They are, essentially, the direct representatives of the narrator’s fantasy world. While enthusiastic narrators may attempt to ‘stat out’ every NPC they create, we caution against investing all your time into areas such as that. While occasionally, a major and consistent NPC may need a full character sheet, more often than not an NPC can be recorded in simpler terms. A name, a general disposition, and a short outline of who they are and where they’ve been. It can also be good to give them ‘rough dice pools’ – such as “Intelligence skills, 5D6” if you expect it to come up.

When preparing enemies for combat, it is important to remember that player characters represent exceptional and standout individuals. Even **‘Initiate’** campaign characters start with 1 attribute point, whereas the average human has 0/0/0 in their attributes.

As a rough guideline, an average person in an average position has 0 attributes, and 2 in their vocational skills. This means a town guard would likely have a dice pool of Base Three, plus 0 for attributes, plus two for a vocational weapon skill such as bows or swords, and then any weapon bonuses.

Elite NPCs, or guard veterans/captains, would likely have a single attribute point, and 3 points in their vocational skills.

Only exceptional NPCs have two or rarely more attribute points in a standard setting, with 4 points in their relevant vocation/weapon skills.

#### Beasts and Monsters

Cogent roleplay has been designed in such a way that its core skills can be used by anything, human or otherwise. And the vocation system allows for creatures to take vocations and unique skills, with points assigned to them as usual. In a simple setting, it would allow for a creature such as a Lion to have the Vocation “Plains Predator” with skill points invested in “Teeth and Claws” for its weapon attacks. Beasts and monsters are the exceptions to the rule that combat skills must align with a weapon type. While it is recommended that you use the weapon types and their combat bonuses as a template, you are free to make up whatever combat skill feels appropriate for a creature. In more esoteric settings, the narrator can use these vocational skills to represent inhuman abilities that they have made part of their campaign setting.

## Supplementary Content


### Expanding from the Core Rules

The goal in creating Cogent Roleplay, has been to create a role-playing system as simple and diverse as possible. In doing so, we understand that, though applications of such a system may be endless, many players enjoy using classic role-play settings like Medieval Fantasy.

We have created some examples of supplementary rules that can be used for some of the more oft-used settings while providing them to you as an example of how you can supplement the Cogent system with your own ideas!

We don’t claim that these supplementary rules are perfectly balanced to be universally applicable, but we do hope that they provide a solid example to you of how to apply the system in ways most suited to your own needs.


### Metahuman Powers in Cogent

Often, settings for games of cogent will be diverse and unique. Games that take place in fantasy settings with wizards and witches as often as science fiction settings with hologram projectors and rocket shoes. All of these settings contain the potential for things to operate in supernatural or superhuman ways that push beyond the limitations outlaid in the Cogent system thus far.

As a general guide, there are two broad ways of achieving this.



* Equipment and Items: By using equipment you effectively control the flow of these abilities through the addition of custom items. Players can obtain and use the items throughout the course of their gameplay, these could have requirements or drawbacks to use, or they may be usable with no downside once acquired. By using equipment as the source of the metahuman powers in your setting, you tie them to the commerce system or your own currency system and can moderate how accessible the most potent powers are.
* Vocations and Vocation Skills: Players use vocations such as “Wizard” to select Vocation Skills and Combat Skills that are suitable for your setting. It is possible that you may choose to allow magical Combat Skills to be used in other situations, or you may decide to balance the potential power of magic that players must invest skill points in the combat AND non-combat applications of a given type of magic. For example, an Elementalist with the Vocation “Earthmage” may need to take points in an “Earthshaping” Vocational Skill in order to craft things from stone using their power but must take “Earth-Fighting” as a Vocational Skill in order to use the elemental earth in combat.

These are just some ideas, and many Narrators will choose to use similar systems or blends of the two. There is no perfect solution, what matters is what works best for the story you would like to tell, and that is one of the greatest advantages of Cogent Roleplay – It is infinitely flexible!

Nevertheless, presented here to use as an example or inspiration is the same school of magic, in both hard and soft magic systems. The school of magic we will use as an example is “Druidic”

A **hard** magic system is one where the boundaries are very deliberate and precise, the exact functions you can perform are outlined in specific spells or items, and players have a clear understanding of exactly what they can cast and what it will do.

A **soft** magic system is one where the limits of what a spellcaster can do are more of guidelines, with challenge level reflecting “roughly what you could do” exerting that level of power with that school of magic. There are pros and cons to each system, and many people favour one over the other, but once again, the correct choice is the one that your gaming group wants to play!

_*Infested is not a condition that currently exists in Cogent Roleplay, but was included to show how you could also make up custom status conditions for your games and magic systems._


### Example Magic Systems

Please note that even though this system is, as of yet, unfinished, it can still be used as the system works off a CL basis. All the player has to do is describe what they wish to do with their spell and the narrator will decide if the spell applies to the action the player is requesting to perform, and then set the CL they must match in order to cast it.

This simple pre-built magic system is given to demonstrate how magic can be incorporated into the Cogent System. It is made to reflect classic fantasy and can be used in your settings or used as an example for one that you make for yourself.

We do recommend that you at least use the individual spells as models for other superpowers or magic systems that you might want to incorporate. For instance the rules and CLs for the Telepathy spell as outlined below work perfectly for a telepathy superpower. Feel free to take and rename what you wish.

It is also made to be perfectly balanced (to the best of our ability) so magic users won’t be overpowered or disadvantaged.


#### Classic Fantasy Magic system

Each spell is an individual proficiency that a player can spend up to two skill points in. They are decently versatile and there’s no limit to the number of times they can be used.

Each spell falls into one or more of the schools or disciplines of magic (wizardry, sorcery, etc) and a player must select a school before they choose any spells to know. It does not cost anything to choose a school of magic but once a school is chosen the player can only select spells from that specific school. This is because each school of magic draws its power from different sources (really it’s for additional game balance and to remain true to the classic fantasy tropes.)

Of course, if the narrator feels that a specific skill fits more with a different school of magic they are more than free to mix and match as they see fit.

The player can choose how to use the spell so long as it falls within the spells guidelines and the Narrator will assign a CL (based on the standard Challenge Level difficulties, 1 common task, 2 uncommon, 3 specialized, etc) that must be matched for the spell to be cast. This means there’s an element of failure in using magic. Failure according to this magic system never means the spell was not cast, it means the spell was miscast, meaning something other than what the player wanted to happen occurred. The level of failure from the CL will ascribe how great a miscast it was and the narrator will fill in the rest.


##### Sorcery spells (proficiencies)


###### Pyromancy

This spell creates and controls fire. It can be used in all the varied and versatile ways that fire can.

This spell can also be used offensively as a base combat roll. The amount of fire that the sorcerer wants to create will determine the CL, set by the Narrator.

Can summon elementals according to the summoning CL table below.

Please note that the number of wins exceeding the CL will determine how long the elemental will remain in the physical plane.

Matching the CL= three rounds



* +1 over the CL= ten rounds
* +2 over the CL = One hour
* +3 over the CL = six hours
* +4 over the CL = a day
* +5 over the CL = Will say with the Sorcerer until dismissed

Rolling under the CL will cause the elemental to attack the sorcerer and it will remain in the world for the equivalent amount of losses under the CL as wins over the CL determines.

Please note that elemental combat rolls can strike multiple opponents

Elementals can only be damaged by other elemental based attacks (they are immune to their own element), magic attacks and receive double damage from attacks by their opposing element. When elementals are struck by a damage type that can harm them, they receive damage in the same way as any other creature and character, meaning an injury severity from combat manoeuvres.


###### Hydromancy

Creates and controls water, the amount and level of control will set the CL determined by the narrator.

Can summon elementals according to the summoning CL table below

Please note that the number of wins exceeding the CL will determine how long the elemental will remain in the physical plane.

Matching the CL= three rounds

###### Aeromancy

Control air, fly, and create gusts of wind.

Aeromancy cannot be used as a base combat proficiency though it can be used to push on people and blow them over.

Aeromancy cannot be used to levitate things, it is too wild and strong for such delicate and controlled movement. Flying through Aeromancy is achieved by thickening the air under the magic user and pushing it past in the direction you want to fly, thus the magic user looks to be in the midst of a windstorm that is solely localized around themselves. This cannot be done to another person or object as thickening the air like this is exponentially harder the farther away from the caster.

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


If using this spell to create a strong gust of wind to knock another player or NPC off their feet, the caster makes a conflict dice roll with their Aeromancy proficiency vs another player/NPC defence roll. Weapon bonuses cannot be used in the defence roll against this type of attack

Aeromancy can summon elementals according to the summoning CL table below

Please note that the number of wins exceeding the CL will determine how long the elemental will remain in the physical plane.

##### Wizardry spells (proficiencies)


###### Divination

Read someone’s future, see through a focusing object (like a crystal ball or calm pool of water) to spy on people or places far away. Communicate over long distances. Prophesy, be warned of danger or traps that lay in wait ahead.

Basically, divination can be used to assist, perception checks, or supplant perception checks if higher, and not be limited by things that are hidden. Of course the farther away things are the higher CL the Narrator will apply.


###### Levitation

Any object of human size and lower doesn’t take a dice check to control unless you are trying to do one of two things:



* Hold another person still who is actively trying to resist. In that case, it is a Conflict CL.
* Manipulate something at a distance or something heavier than normal human size and weight.

You can manipulate weapons and attack with them as if you were holding them but you do not use your Telekinesis Proficiency in the attack roll. Instead, you use whatever proficiency that weapon requires.

Using levitation to throw things as projectiles uses your levitation proficiency

The following CLs are to be used for the specified actions

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



###### Telepathy

No dice checks are required when trying to read or communicate to a non-resisting person’s mind. A player or NPC can try and resist telepathy with an intelligence roll or even their own Telepathy proficiency. If a person is resisting you must exceed their roll to read what they are thinking, exceed their roll by 2 to probe their mind and look for specific thoughts or memories and exceed their role by 4 to inflict an injury level. Each dice beyond the four is an additional injury level inflicted.


###### Counteraction

With this spell the wizard can counter any other spell from any other type of magic. Countering a spell can do one of two things:

If the Counter Spell roll was equal to the roll of the spell it’s trying to counter, it can prevent the spell from being cast.

If the Counter Spell roll is greater than the spell it is trying to counter the wizard casting the Counter Spell can choose for the spell they are countering to be miscast (see miscast above.) The level of miscast depends on how much the wizard exceeded the spell roll of the spell they are countering.


###### Teleportation

<!--H6 not demoted to H7. -->


###### Self teleportation

This is the ability to teleport yourself (no other objects) to desired locations. Please note that all CLs are doubled if trying to teleport to an unseen location

###### Other teleportation

This is the ability to teleport other objects, not oneself to desired locations. You must be able to see the object to teleport it. If you are teleporting something close to you to a distant location, always use the farthest distance to determine the CL. Please note that all CLs are doubled if trying to teleport something to an unseen location

###### Prestidigitation

Create soft light

Reduce soft heat/cold

Tiny illusion

Create fog

Create a protective shield of magic

Small magical tricks


###### Illusion

Invisibility is included in illusion


##### Witchcraft spells (proficiencies)


###### Alteration

Can change the composition of an element or change it into a lighter element. Making something into a lighter element will increase its size. It is possible to change something into a heavier element but requires much more power and exhausts the witch more. The heavier the change the harder it is.

<!--H6 not demoted to H7. -->


###### Transform objects

This is complex and requires a lot of power. Using this spell will usually drain the witch for a day

Chemical effects in substances can be completely reversed through alteration, such as altering a poison into a life-saving, injury-healing potion.


###### Polymorph

Transforms people and themselves into other creatures. The greater the difference from the original form, the greater the CL


###### Domination

To work this spell the Witch needs a physical thing representing their target, a doll that has a fingernail or lock of hair from the person they wish to dominate.

This spell begins with manipulating the emotions in their target, then being able to plant thoughts and ideas into their minds and ultimately taking over their body for a few rounds. The Narrator will set the CL for each different application of this spell.


###### Sympathy

This magic bonds two things and then can switch properties between the two, such as passing on the properties of one thing to the other making the other, weaker, stronger, lighter or heavier.

When two things are linked or bonded through sympathy, with a high enough CL their physical locations can be switched, no matter their location. And ultimately through sympathy, two bonded creatures can have their consciousness switched either temporarily, or permanently.


##### Druidism spells


###### Naturmancy. 

Can control non-intelligent living things, cause trees to move and vines to snare, or wood to warp.

Cause a natural element to harden or soften, wood stronger than steel, steel softer than butter) (causes the thing to decay including people, or causes weapons to rust extremely fast.)

Can summon forest elementals

Please note that the number of wins exceeding the CL will determine how long the elemental will remain in the physical plane.

Matching the CL = One round



* +1 over the CL= three rounds
* +2 over the CL= ten rounds
* +3 over the CL = One hour
* +4 over the CL = six hours
* +5 over the CL = a day
* +6 over the CL = Will say with the Sorcerer until dismissed

Rolling under the CL will cause the elemental to attack the sorcerer and it will remain in the world for the equivalent amount of losses under the CL as wins over the CL determines.

Please note that elemental combat rolls can strike multiple opponents

Natural Elementals can be damaged by regular attacks as well as other elemental based attacks, magic attacks and receive double damage from attacks by fire. When elementals are struck by a damage type that can harm them, they receive damage in the same way as any other creature and character, meaning in injury severity from combat manoeuvres.

### Random Encounter Tables for Classic Medieval Fantasy


#### For Medieval Combat

These charts are mainly for use by the narrator of the Champaign and can be adapted to other genres.

With any encounter, there is still room to move. They can be small or severe in their fulfilment. With each encounter, a severity roll must accompany it to determine how extreme or mild it is. This applies to weather and monsters and is done with a D6


##### Severity roll



* 1-2 Mild
* 3-4 Average
* 5-6 heavy


##### Weather

There are two rolls for a weather check. The first is according to the following weather charts on a 1d100 (2D10 dice.) The second is a severity check, is it drizzling or heavy rain?

The weather check should last for about two days but you can have them last for one day or a week, it’s your choice but two days represents the most realistic weather conditions. A new weather roll every day could represent turbulent weather conditions at that time in the game.

The severity check determines the severity of the weather for that day. The severity check should be done every day in the game.

The following charts represent a mild climate. If the players are based in or travel to a different climate such as a desert or a mountain peak, add 10 to 20 on the 1d100 weather roll if the climate is hotter (10 to 20 because a desert is different to the tropics, both hotter but different to each other) and subtract 10 to 20 if the climate is colder.

The natural disaster result only applies if it is a natural 100 roll. If the characters are in a hotter climate and 10 is added to the weather roll, the natural disaster result only applies if a natural 100 was rolled, if 100 was achieved by adding to the roll, it is effectively 99, not 100.

Likewise, if the characters are in a colder climate and a 100 was rolled, the subtraction doesn’t count and the result is a natural disaster regardless.

Note; snow lasts much longer than any other weather condition, especially if the weather is cold. If snow was a result of a weather roll, and the following roll is cold, the snow remains on the ground.

## Hardcore Combat [Optional]


### Hardcore Combat

We have made Cogent to be as simple as possible but understand that sometimes simplicity comes at the detriment to realism and sophistication. In the cases where we have seen that further refinement of the rules would more accurately reflect real and satisfying combat, we have made a hardcore variant of that specific rule system and provided them below.


### Hardcore Armour Rules

The hardcore armour rules make armour significantly more powerful and reflect reality better.

Armour levels are calculated by adding the armour ratings of each specific piece of armour being worn, which will then give the character their total armour level.

Armour also adds weight which affects combat. Half the player's total armour level (rounded down) is subtracted from their total combat roll.

A character can then reduce injury levels by the equivalent amount of levels they have in armour.

The preset injury reduction that armour provides is permanent and applies to every injury the player receives in every combat encounter, meaning the only way to injure an opponent in armour is to exceed their armour score, or bypass it.

In these circumstances, the most efficient way of defeating a person in armour is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life.

Having said this, the hardcore armour rules are only truly balanced in the game mechanics if the Narrator and Players are also employing the hardcore weapon modifiers. Without the hardcore weapon modifiers, it will be very difficult, to impossible, to injure an opponent with a significantly high armour rating (unless you immobilize them or employ other combat modifiers.) A level eight victory is VERY hard to achieve, which would be needed to inflict even a minor injury to an opponent with an armour score of 7.

Below are the armour categories and if applicable in the setting a character can wear two pieces of armour in the same category, such as wearing a gambeson under chainmail or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history. When this happens the armour rating stack, which is not necessarily a good thing as a higher armour rating subtracts more from a character’s combat roll.

The ratings as given are a guide and the Narrators can change this as they wish to make armour more or less significant in their game.

### Hardcore Weapon Modifiers

These hardcore weapon rules are a little more sophisticated and are completely optional. Having said that, these rules are made to accompany the hardcore armour rules and balance the game mechanics while reflecting reality better.

These modifiers are made to reflect the true characteristics of individual weapons because even though a mace and an arming sword are both one-handed weapons, they are severely different in use and effectiveness in different combative circumstances, like fighting an opponent in armour. Thus these rules break down weapons further into more specific categories.

Also, the hardcore weapon bonuses allow for weapons to be used in multiple ways. For instance, a poleaxe has a hammerhead as well as an axe head and a long spike, allowing it to be used as a reach-hafted blunt, reach-hafted blade, or a reach-hafted point weapon. The player must specify in what way they are using their weapon to the Narrator and cannot backtrack. If the player doesn’t specify in which way they are using their weapon it is assumed they were using the weapon in their standard function.

### Hardcore Ranged Rules

that can be used when employing ballistic weapons. WARNING, these rules are called hardcore for a reason. It is VERY easy to die when using these rules, just like in real life when dealing with ballistic weapons. If these rules are not used when employing ballistic weapons the players will have an active chance to defend against ballistic attacks, such as dodging. While this isn’t realistic it does convey a superhuman level of combative skill and if that is the campaign you want to play, the regular rule system will work perfectly. Indeed both these rule systems can be used, the regular people having to follow the hardcore rules while the exceptionally skilled/superhuman/scientifically advanced people get to follow the regular combat rules.

The key difference in the hardcore rules is that ranged combat rolls are done against static **Challenge Levels** determined by the distance and size of the target. Their total combat roll is calculated exactly the same, except that they are not trying to beat another player’s roll. Every win over the CL stands as a level of victory the player achieves against their opponent. Those attacked by weapons that use the hardcore rules cannot make any defence roll at all. Ballistic weapons (or other similar weapons like laser guns) work differently to, say, bows, because one cannot actively defend against a fired bullet. They can prepare before the gun is fired such as ducking behind the cover or wearing armour, but once the gun is fired and its aim was true, you’ll get hit.
