While many tabletop RPGs focus on killing monsters . . . sometimes you will want them on your side! 

The Cogent System Community Project’s rules for taming have the following goals:

1. To ensure that in the narrative there is a **plausible connection** between tamer and tamed.
2. Provide a way to **describe a Creature’s abilities and personality**, without a complicated stat block.
3. To ensure Creatures do not become “Pokémon in the PC.” These rules acknowledge that **taking on a creature requires commitment** from the fictional character.
4. Ensure creatures **do not replace** the player characters.

## Describing a Monster's Behavior

A monster's behavior is described with the following:

- **Triggers** - These events / actions, should they occur will anger the creature.  Each Trigger increases the **Hostility Penalty.**
- **Motivators** - These events / actions, should the creature observe them will pacify the monster, either removing all or at least decreasing the current Hostility Penalty. 
- **Compatible Vocations** - These are the sorts of vocations that the creature tends to connect with.  If a player seeks to tame a monster and does not have a compatible vocation, their taming check will be at a -2 Successes penalty. 
- **Hostility** - This can range from -1 to -4. Any attempt to tame has its net decreases by this amount, unless a Motivator has been fulfilled to clear the Hostility level.
- **Tame Method** - What must be done to tame the monster.  When the player initiates a tame, this is what they concretely are doing.  Possible options are:
  - **Offer Food** - A **Lure** is offered to the creature to show friendly intent
  - **Capture** - The creature is lead into a **trap** or **capture device** some sort
  - **Battle for Dominance** - A currently tamed Monster battles the untamed Monster for Dominance
  - **Psionic Connection** - The Characters Psionic / Magical / Weird science capabilities allows their mind to connect to the monster's mind to communicate.  

 ## Describing a Creature's Capabilities

### Tier and Tier Attributes

A monster has a Tier, usually from 0 to 4.  Furthermore, the monster will have Tier Attributes.  For a player to be able to tame the monster they must have points in the attributes of the monster that, when all added together, equal the monster's Tier.

**Example:** A Tier 2 Creature has the Tier Attributes Strength and Reflex.  This creature can be tamed by a player with 2 in Strength, OR 2 in Reflex OR 1 in Strength and 1 in Reflex. 

The Tier Value is added to any Dice Pool the creature participates in.

### Creature Skills - Motivating Drive

All monsters have a **Motivating Drive** and a number of points dedicated to that.  Whenever pursing this motivating drive they can use their Motivating Drive as an Assist (either for themselves or for their tamer, should their tamer be helping them achieve their Motivating Drive)  

In some ways the Motivating Drive is the Monster's Vocation.  The remaining skills cannot have more points in them, than have been given to the Motivating Drive.  

### Creature Skills - Monster Attack and Monster Resource

A monster must have at least one point in Monster Attack or Monster Resource (or both).  These Skills are what the monster uses to survive.  The Monster Attack describes how the creature hunts.  The Monster Resource describes something the creature gathers and collects. 

### Free Skills

The monster can have additional Free Skills.  

### Types

Types can be designated in a setting.  Each monster that fits that type has the shared Type Ability.  The dice pool they roll when using that type ability is equal to the dice pool they roll when using their Motivating Drive.  

## Taming

Based on the narrative, some monsters will be **Inherently Hostile.** These, by definition, cannot be tamed. Some Creatures are Inherently Hostile by default, but fulfilling a **Motivator** will remove this condition.

As described above, the taming character will need enough points in the correct attributes to be able to tame the creature.

Furthermore, certain creatures “connect” better with people of certain vocations. To tame the creature, you will need to succeed on a check with a compatible vocation. 

To ensure no creature becomes forgotten, there is a maximum number of creatures you can tame – **you can have no more creatures than you have points invested in your vocation.** 

So, if you have 2 points in your vocation, you can control at any one time 2 creatures related to that vocation.

### Taming Process

1. The **4 Prerequisites of Taming a Creature** are Fulfilled:

a.   Creature is not / no longer **inherently hostile**

b.   The tamer has **sufficient attribute points** for the creature’s Tier

c.   The tamer is not over their **max creatures**

d.   The tamer has a **compatible vocation** ( or is willing to accept a -2 penalty to their tame attempt)

2. The tamer performs the action implied by the Tame Method (e.g. offering a Lure, setting a trap, using a Psionic device etc.)
3. The tamer succeeds on a **tame check** equal to 2 + the monster’s Tier (so 3 for a Tier 1 Creature) using their compatible vocation.

### Scale and Taming
If a creature is a size category larger than you, you will occur the penalty that is described in the **Scale** Core Rules.  If you already have tamed monsters, for the purposes of determining Scale difference you are considered to have the Scale of the largest creature you have tamed.  Thus, if one wants to eventually tame collosal creatures, you will likely need to move through the size categories, using ever larger creatures to tame creatures the next Scale category up.  

## What Can I do with my new Monster Friend?

Your monster, once tamed, is treated very similarly to a Vocation. If you need an *Assist* with a roll, and it is plausible that your monster could aid you, you can do an assist roll with one of your monster's skills or their Motivating Drive just as you would with a human’s vocation. 

The pool for the assist roll will be the standard 3d6 + a number of d6 equal to the monster’s Tier + a number of d6 equal to the applicable skill of the creature. 

**Monsters should only be used for Assist Rolls. This is to ensure that the Player Characters are always the ones driving the main action.**

Some examples below will illustrate.  

 

### Some example Creatures and Their Uses

 **Cerberus – Might 2**

**Compatible Vocations:** Any related to death, spiritual or physical, including soldiers, priests and doctors

**Hostility Key:** As guardians of the underworld, Cerberus have a grim respect for the death and often appear in our world when some necromantic force undermines the natural order of death. A Cerberus that sees you destroy an object of necromancy will come to respect you.

**Favored Food Source:** Meat

**Motivating Drive** – Canine Guardian of Death - 3

Bite – 3

Track – 3

Follow Scent – 2

Jump - 2

This example, the Cerberus, is a great choice for a GM running a campaign about necromancy. The scenario’s plot explains why the creature would be there. Furthermore players, in the course of fulfilling the main plot, will be able to earn the creature’s respect. Thus, it is narratively plausible that a healthy relationship between tamer and tamed could occur. 

Let’s say the Party has tracked the Necromancer down to an abandoned castle and they need to determine where in the castle the Necromancer is hiding. Before doing a *Perception* check themselves, the player could suggest to the GM that the tracking talents of the Cerberus could provide a valuable assist. They roll 3d6 (base) + 2d6 (for the creature’s Tier) + 2d6 (for the boxes in “Follow Scent”) for a dice pool of 7d6. 

As with a normal Assist roll, any successes could then be applied to the main roll.

Here is a less spooky example of a monster:

**Trickster Pixie– Reflex 1**

**Compatible Vocations:** Any related to Charisma, performance, persuasion, or thievery

**Hostility Key:** Trickster Pixies are great pranksters (much to the chagrin of many adventuring parties). A Trickster Pixie that sees a character pull off a prank (on the Pixie themselves or on another character) will come to respect them as a kindred spirit.

**Favored Food Source:** Berries

**Motivating Drive** – PRANKISH FUN! - 3

Illusion – 2

Harvest Herbs – 3

Espionage – 2

Setting Fires - 2

This creature could provide some comic relief during a campaign. Perhaps on the way to fight some orcs the party wakes up to find that their gear has been stolen by the Trickster Pixie. To get it back a suitable prank would need to be pulled on the Pixie. Despite the momentary inconvenience, the party may find that it is useful to have a clever, small, and deviously smart ally, once a tame is completed. 

Let’s say the Party wants to sneak into the General’s Tent. Before doing the *Stealth* check, they use the Trickster Pixies skill in “Setting Fires” for an Assist. They want the Pixie to set fire to the camp to provide a diversion. They roll 3d6 (base) + 1d6 (for the creatures Tier) + 2d6 (for “Setting Fires”). Any and all successes above 3 can be added to the main Stealth roll. 

 

## Releasing Monster

As discussed, you can have no more monsters than you have points in your own Vocation. Should you want to acquire a new monster but you have no slots remaining, you will need to release one of your monsters, or at least transfer it to a different player. 

Animals take time, energy, and responsibility. It is not possible to control and do right by an endless amount of them,

Furthermore, this limitation can ensure that different monsters impact the main plot.

## Training Monsters

Monsters learn more slowly than Humans, and their ability to learn is greatly impacted by the skill of their tamer. 

While it is possible to own a creature that has more points in its Motivating Drive than you have in your Vocation, you will not be able to train it up until your Vocation is at least as trained as the monster’s Motivating Drive. 

So, to use our prior example, to add points to the Trickster Pixie’s skills, your vocation would need at least 3 points in it. 

In campaign play, two **Monster Skill Points** are awarded at the end of each arc to each tamed creature that was present in the narrative (tamed or not) for at least half the chapters in that arc.

If a player wants to train a monster faster, two unspent “human” skill points can be traded for 1 creature skill point at any time. 

Remember that a monster's skills can not be greater than the points in the Motivating Drive.

If a player wants to give a creature a brand-new skill, as opposed to increasing skills it already has, this must be negotiated with the GM. 

The new skill must be feasible for the type of animal the creature is, and furthermore there must be a narrative explanation as to how the tamer gave the creature this new skill. 

## Monster Death
### Monster Death – Option 1

Tamed Monsters have plot armor (and I-want-the-player-to-still-be-friends-with me armor) and thus cannot be killed. 

All jokes aside, for some people who hate animal death in stories this may be the best option.

### Monster Death – Option 2

Tamed monsters are easier to kill than humans, or untamable creatures. Thus a human that scores a number of Victory Levels against a monster in combat scores one more additional victory level than normal. 

Thus, a Level 4 Victory is what would be needed to bring about a pet monster’s death.
