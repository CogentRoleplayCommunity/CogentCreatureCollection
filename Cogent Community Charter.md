# 1. We are the Community
<p>The Cogent Community Project is a 100% volunteer organization, and as such all that abide by this Charter and volunteer to the project are considered part of the Cogent Community Project.  All Community Members will abide by the following:</p>

1. **Respect the Work:** All proposals, ideas, suggestions, and criticisms made within the Project will be treated by the Community with equal respect and consideration.
1. **All are Welcome:** Any who choose to volunteer their time are welcome, and all their contributions will be accepted with equal respect and consideration.
1. **Don't be a Troll:** You are strong, because We are strong.  All Community Members are expected to act in a respectful way to all other Community Members.  Harassment, discrimination, or disrespect will not be tolerated.

# 2. See a Need, Fill a Need
<p>The Cogent Community Project will succeed or fail as a Community.  When a fellow Community Member reaches out for help, their struggle is your struggle.  Do what you can to help them.</p>

1. **Ask for Help:** Do not suffer alone.  If you run into a roadblock, reach out to the Community for help.  
1. **Lend a Hand:** Do not let your Community Members suffer alone.  If someone reaches out for help, do your best to find them the help they need (even if it is pointing them to a Community Member(s) that will help them).
1. **The Backlog:** The Project will be creating an Issue and Proposal Backlog of defects and features the Community Members wish to see in Cogent.  Community Members should:
    * **Help prioritize the list:** All Community Members get to vote on all items, and an item's value is based on the votes from the Community Members.
    * **Help complete items on the list:** As a Volunteer you do not need permission to take any item from the Backlog and work on them.  Let others know what you are working on (***Ask for Help***) and ensure you save your work to the Project.

# 3. Nothing is Sacred, Everything is Permissible
<p>The Cogent Community is grateful to Shad and Jazza for giving us Cogent.  Without their foundation we would not have this Project.  But in order for the Project to grow, we must be free of any constraints to do what me must to make Cogent the best tabletop roleplaying game ever.</p>

1. **No Idea is Stupid:** All ideas, irregardless on how they sound at first, will be treated with equal respect and consideration.  The Community Members will listen to the proposition with an open mind, and prioritize the proposal as any other item in the Backlog.
1. **All Ideas Must be Tested:** No idea on the Backlog will be removed from the Backlog or added to a Release Candidate until after it has been through playtesting.  Playtests must not include the proposer of the item, and playtesters must treat the playtest with equal respect and consideration to any other item in the Backlog.
1. **Give Constructive Criticism:** When rejecting an idea (either from a playtest, or in the development of the item), any criticism must provide the Volunteers a path to further fix and/or refine the item further.  If you disagree with an item, you must state why.  If you have an itea on how to make it better, you must provide it.

# 4. Monetization
Cogent Roleplay is licensed under an **Open License**.  As such you must give Cogent Roleplay *Attribution* acknowledgement on any derived work based on Cogent.  Cogent Roleplay does not prohibit publishers from publishing physical copies of Cogent Roleplay, but does prohibit publishing on behalf of Cogent Roleplay.

1. **Support the Founders:** The Cogent Community Project intends to sell any Cogent Roleplay System content at cost, and any profit will be [Donated](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tabletoptime) back to Jazza and Shad.
1. **Homebrew Content and Mods:** Content created that does not include the Cogent Roleplay System content (including but not limited to, Campaign Settings, Equipment Guides, or Modules to be added to Cogent) are considered the combined owner of the Backlog item Volunteers, and the Project will split any profits equally between Volunteers of any published Backlog item.
1. **Translations:** Translations of the Cogent Roleplay System will go to the Community Members on a case by case bases to determine if any profits should go to the Founders, or split between the Volunteers of the Translation.
